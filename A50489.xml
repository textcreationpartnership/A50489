            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I know it is the matter of your Prayers, and let me beg you to joyn thereunto your utmoſt indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours by a ſtrict and pious educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the common want of which hath ſtained the preſent age with as <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched</hi> a <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> as ever any time brought forth. And <hi>Madam,</hi> if to all this you ſhall add the winning motive of your own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, ſo walking in all the Precepts of Chriſt, and in all the virtues of the Holy Spirit, that they may be won into the ways of God by the beauty of your feet, O what an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and rejoycing would this be to you in the near approaching day of Chriſt Jeſus. How many children have been brought into love with the ways of God by the holy example of Godly Parents. And many more have periſhed by the contrary, who are now curſing the Parents that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat

them, and the loyns that brought them forth.</p>
            <p>I no way doubt of your <hi>Honours</hi> ready acceptance of this Preſent, how mean ſoever it be; Seeing it is a great bravery of mind as well to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>little</hi> kindneſſes (from them that have no better within their reach) as to confer <hi>great</hi> ones; For as by the latter you <hi>oblige love,</hi> ſo by the former you <hi>incourage duty.</hi> Thus the full Sea ſtocks Clouds richly, while they pay again but by drops.

            <p>THough thy concern lies not much in knowing the reaſon of the publication of this Treatiſe, yet it may not be amiſs to give thee this ſhort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it. That in <hi>April</hi> 1674, A Gentleman (who was till then a ſtranger to me) came with an earneſt requeſt that I would undertake the Preaching of a Sermon yearly on every <hi>May-day</hi> to the <hi>younger</hi> people. I deſiring to know his reaſon why to them, rather then to others? and why on that day rather then upon any other? he told me, that it had often been the grief of his Soul to behold the viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and debauched practiſes of <hi>Youth</hi> on that day of liberty. And
<pb facs="tcp:63179:10"/>
did hope that many might be induced, either by their own inclinations, or by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of their Parents, or Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, rather to ſpend their time in hearing a Sermon; then in drinking and gaming <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which means many might be converted and ſaved. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign being ſo honeſt, and the reaſon ſo cogent, I was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to comply with it: and began upon the following <hi>May Day,</hi> and ſo it hath been conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ever ſince; and I may ſay it, not in any boaſt, but to the praiſe of the glory of the grace of God, with great ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>On <hi>May-day</hi> 1680 I took the Scripture here inſiſted on for the ſubject of my diſcourſe; and having then ſhewed the great advantage of bearing the <hi>Yoke
<pb facs="tcp:63179:10"/>
of vfflictions,</hi> and alſo the <hi>Yoke of the Spirit in conviction</hi> of ſin in youth; I did promiſe (God granting life and liberty) to treat of <hi>the Yoke of Chriſt in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion</hi> in the next Anniverſary courſe. But before that day came I was much ſollicited, both by young and old, (they beſt know why) to make publick the firſt Sermon which I had ſo Preached; and it was fairly tranſcribed, and ſent to me by ſeveral hands for that end; which yet I judged very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper: but to anſwer their importunity I did promiſe that when I had finiſhed the ſubject, I would comply with their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. And therefore finding that I could not compaſs my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in the ſecond <hi>May-day</hi> courſe, I did for ſome Lords days fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb facs="tcp:63179:11"/>
inſiſt on the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, till I had finiſhed it: And that thou hadſt it no ſooner the <hi>Bookſeller</hi> is accountable, and not I. However if it may be of any advantage to thy ſoul in breaking off the yoke of ſin and luſt, and bringing thee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the yoke of Chriſt; it comes in good time, and to good purpoſe. And when thou findeſt this benefit by it, then pray for him that loves thy ſoul, and deſires thy Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therein is</p>

               <p>THE Apoſtle tells us that <hi>great is the Myſtery of Godlineſs;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.16.</note> and it is ſo, not only in <hi>credendis,</hi> the things which are to be believed, but in <hi>agendis,</hi> the matters that relate to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. There are Myſteries in the Precept as well as in the Promiſe.<note place="margin">Pſal. 55.22.</note> If a man be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to caſt his burthen upon the Lord, then he himſelf hath none to bear; and yet
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63179:14"/>
the Lord Chriſt lays a burthen upon every Believer;<note place="margin">Matth. 11.30. Rev. 2.24.</note> where he is a Redeemer, he ſets the ſoul free from every <hi>Yoke</hi> it is under, and <hi>if the Son make a man free,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 8.36.</note> 
                  <hi>he is then free in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</hi> And yet none are more under the <hi>Yoke</hi> than the Lords Freemen <hi>being not without Law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.21.</note> 
                  <hi>but under the Law to Chriſt.</hi> When he takes off one, he puts on another, <hi>Take my Yoke upon you,</hi> Matth. 11.29.</p>
               <p>Though Chriſt breaks our <hi>Fetters,</hi> yet he brings us into <hi>Bonds;</hi> though he delivers us from thraldom and ſlavery, yet not from du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; he redeems us from the power of ſin, but not from the power of the Precept: and therefore to argue from liberty to licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs, is a kind of Logick found only in the Devil's School,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Shall we continue in ſin that Grace may abound? God forbid.</hi> The right reaſoning is from mercy to duty, <hi>Ye are bought with a price; therefore glorifie God in your Body, and your Spirits, which are Gods,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.20.</p>
               <p>Redemption and ſervice are, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Goſpel,<note place="margin">Luke 1.74, 75.</note> linked together, <hi>That we being delivered out of the hands of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies might ſerve him without fear, in holineſs and righteouſneſs before him all the days of our life.</hi> The freedom purchaſed by Chriſt makes ſervice neceſſary; for he quits us of our <hi>burden,</hi> but not of our <hi>obedience;</hi> he doth not ſet us free from ſervice, but changes our work and our Maſter,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.19.</note> 
                  <hi>As ye have yielded your members ſervants to uncleanneſs, and to iniquity unto iniquity; even ſo now yield your
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63179:14"/>
members ſervants to righteouſneſs, unto holineſs:</hi> So that ye are Servants ſtill. It was the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the Fleſh and fleſhly luſts that was ſerved before, but now it is the intereſt of God and holineſs; the freedom then is from the Government of the God of this World, who <hi>rules in the Children of diſobedience,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.2.</note> unto a voluntary ſubmiſſion and reſignedneſs to the Divine conduct; from the brutiſh drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery of ſin, to the excellency of ſuch an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.11.</note> whoſe Precepts carry their own reward with them, beſides the Glory that enſues. So then the <hi>Yoke</hi> that hath a curſe in it, that Chriſt hath took off, but the <hi>Yoke</hi> of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that he hath call'd us to put on; and herein he hath excellently accommodated things to the great advantage of man. For as it is his miſery and burthen to be under the former <hi>Yoke,</hi> (which, what it is, I ſhall ſhew anon) ſo it is as much his intereſt and happineſs to be under the latter; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the earlier he takes it up, the ſooner he begins to be happy. <hi>It is good for a man that he bear the Yoke in his Youth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall not ſpeak any thing of this Book in general, only a little about the manner of penning it, which is ſomewhat unuſual; each Chapter (the laſt only excepted) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing penned according to the Order in which the Letters ſtand in the Hebrew Alphabet, as ſome of the Pſalms of <hi>David</hi> are. For what reaſon the Spirit of God ſhould direct the Pen-man of it this way, it doth not appear. <hi>Hierom</hi> labours to find out great myſteries in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63179:15"/>
it, but doth but beat the Air. This way of writing ſeems to be very uſeful for the help of the memory, and may ſeem to hint as if God would have ſuch Scriptures peculiarly remarked and remembred, and that is the beſt reaſon I can give.</p>
               <p>But whereas the firſt, ſecond and fourth Chapters begin with a ſingle <hi>Alphabet,</hi> the ſeveral Verſes beginning with ſeveral Letters in their Order, this third Chapter conſiſteth of a threefold <hi>Alphabet,</hi> every three Verſes in courſe beginning with the ſame Letter.</p>
               <p>This Text, which I have pitched upon, falls under the Letter [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] which <hi>Hierome</hi> makes to ſtand for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſignifies Good; and accordingly the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Verſes do all begin in the Hebrew with the word <hi>Tobh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">

                     </gap>
                  </note>So in the 25th Verſe, <hi>Tobh Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah Lekovau, Good is the Lord to them that wait for him.</hi>

                     </gap>
                  </note>So the 26th Verſe, <hi>Tobh vejah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil vedumam.</hi> It is <hi>good a man ſhould both hope and quietly wait.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The only difficulty in the Text that needs explaining is, What <hi>Yoke</hi> it is that is here meant.</p>

               <p>Indeed meaner perſons are forced to put their Children to Trades for an after ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, but the Nobility and Gentry of the Nation are in this thing the ſhame of it; it is reckoned below a Perſon of Quality to be a Mechanick; and therefore how many, that might otherwiſe have been uſeful in their Generation, are bred up in idleneſs, and ſo fit only to be reckoned among the Vermine of the Earth! whilſt they live only to eat what others earn, and inſtead of proving the <hi>Pillars,</hi> they prove the <hi>Caterpillars</hi> of the Nation: and it is ſeldom but that idleneſs and wickedneſs go together. <hi>Thou wicked and ſlothful Servant,</hi> ſaid our Lord Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.26.

               <p n="2">2. It prevents many temptations. Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the Back-door for all temptations to come in at. It tempts the Devil to tempt

us. It is a good Rule one gives for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding ſin and temptation, Be always em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, that when Satan comes he may not find thee at leiſure. Many have been kept from great temptations by being diligent in their Callings, and many by idle diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have fallen into great temptations and ſnares. <hi>Dinah</hi> wanders abroad, and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowred before ſhe comes home; <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells of a Chriſtian Woman who going to ſee a Play, was there poſſeſſed by the Devil; and when he was asked (by ſome who came to her, and ſet themſelves to pray him out) how he durſt poſſeſs one that was a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an? He anſwered, <hi>I found her in my own Ground.</hi> Oh how ſhould this warn young ones to take heed of the <hi>Play-houſes?</hi> Theſe are the <hi>Devils Ground,</hi> and what he finds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own Ground, he will poſſeſs as his own. He is the Lord of that Mannor, and being ſo, the <hi>Waifs</hi> and <hi>Eſtrays</hi> are all his. Let young ones therefore take up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of ſome lawful Calling betimes. But this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil <hi>Yoke</hi> is not the <hi>Yoke</hi> in the Text.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>Yoke,</hi> as Metaphorically taken, is uſed in a Moral or Religious ſenſe; and ſo there is a threefold <hi>Yoke</hi> which it is not good to bear, and a threefold <hi>Yoke</hi> which it is good to bear.</p>
               <p>There is a threefold <hi>Yoke</hi> which is not good to bear,</p>
               <p>The <hi>Yoke</hi> of <hi>Moſaical</hi> Ceremonies,</p>
               <p>The <hi>Yoke</hi> of Antichriſtian Impoſitions,</p>
               <p>The <hi>Yoke</hi> of ſin and luſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:63179:18"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Yoke</hi> of <hi>Moſaical</hi> Ceremonies. This in its day was a ſtrict <hi>Yoke,</hi> a heavy <hi>Yoke,</hi> a <hi>Yoke</hi> (as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſays) <hi>which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we nor our Fathers were able to bear,</hi> Acts 15.10.</p>
               <p>But this <hi>Yoke</hi> the Lord Chriſt hath freed us from, the Ceremonial Law was aboliſhed by him, and had no uſe after his death; but by accident, as he who builds a Vault lets the Centrels ſtand till he puts in the Key<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and then pulls them away. So that now the Rule is, <hi>Stand faſt in the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made us free, and be not intangled again in the Yoke of bondage,</hi> Gal. 5.1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Antichriſt, which is made up of humane inventions and impoſitions in the Worſhip of God; on which foundation all the Will-worſhip, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition and Idolatry, which at this day ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in the World, do ſtand.</p>
               <p>This is a heavier <hi>Yoke</hi> than the former, for that had once the ſanction of God, and there the authority made the ſubjection reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, though burthenſom; but this never had, and therefore more grievous, becauſe herein we are made Slaves to the <hi>luſts</hi> of men, whereas in that we were Subjects to the <hi>will</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>And therefore to be impoſed upon by Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of mens deviſing, when we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually freed by Chriſt from the Ceremonies that were once of Gods appointing,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bagſhaw</hi>'s Great Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion about things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different.</note> is a very heavy <hi>Yoke,</hi> a <hi>Yoke</hi> which one ſays is in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63179:19"/>
the Impoſer, tyranny; and in the Perſons im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon, burden and bondage. And therefore a <hi>Yoke</hi> which without ſin (in tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing the Precept of our Lord Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 23.8.</note> and his Apoſtle) we may not ſubmit to.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.23.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Becauſe hereby we owne a power in the Impoſers over conſcience, which God never gave to any; and ſo abet them in their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful uſurpations upon the Prerogative of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Pſal. 2.6. Iſai. 9.6. Matth. 28.18.</note> who alone is King and Head of the Church, and hath the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon his ſhoulders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And alſo becauſe we make our ſelves to be what, in things appertaining to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, we are commanded not to be, <hi>viz.</hi> the Servants of men, <hi>Ye are bought with a price, be not ye the ſervants of men,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.23.</p>
               <p>This then is another <hi>Yoke,</hi> which we ought not to bear, <q>When once <hi>humane inventions</hi> become <hi>Impoſitions,</hi> and lay a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity upon that which God hath left free, then may we lawfully reject them as <hi>Plants</hi> of <hi>mans ſetting,</hi> and not of <hi>Gods own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and which he will therefore in his time aſſuredly root up, <bibl>Matth. 15.13.</bibl>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is the <hi>Yoke</hi> of ſin and luſt. For though Sinners are ſaid to be <hi>Children of Belial,</hi> that is, <hi>without Yoke</hi>

And this is the Reign of Satan in the ſoul of a Sinner; for as the Lord Chriſt reigns in the hearts of his people by the power of Grace and righteouſneſs, ſo Satan reigns in the hearts of wicked men by the power of ſin and luſt.</p>
               <p>Now it cannot be good in any ſenſe to bear this <hi>Yoke,</hi> becauſe it every way tends to the hurt and miſchief of the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As it breaks off the <hi>Yoke</hi> of God, which is everyway ſuited to the good and advantage of man. For the <hi>commandment is holy, juſt and good,</hi> Rom. 7.12. <hi>[holy]</hi> as it is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion

               <p n="2">2. As it inſlaves the Creature to the baſeſt bondage, and moſt unreaſonable vaſſalage in the World.

               <p>And can it be good to bear this <hi>Yoke?</hi> What! to oppoſe God? to be a Slave to ſin? to reject the Reign of Chriſt? to reſiſt the Spirit? to ſlight the Grace of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel? to gratifie the Devil? and to undo thy own ſoul?

AFflictions may be called a <hi>Yoke,</hi> and ſo they are often in Scripture, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.13. <hi>I am the Lord your God, which brought you forth out of the Land of Egypt— and I have broken the Bonds of your Yoke, and made you go upright.</hi> He ſpeaks of the great affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions with which <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ſo oppreſſed and burthened in <hi>Egypt,</hi> that their backs were bowed down, and they were even ſunk and broken under them: and this God calls their affliction, <hi>I have ſurely ſeen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt,</hi> Exod. 3.7. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.6, 7. <hi>The Egyptians evilly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated us and afflicted us, and when we cried to the Lord, he heard our voice, and looked on our affliction and oppreſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this ſeems to be the Yoke intended
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63179:21"/>
in the Text, at leaſt to the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> that were then in <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> bondage, which the Holy Ghoſt calls a <hi>Yoke, Jer.</hi> 27.12. <hi>Bring your necks under the Yoke of the King of Babylon.</hi> And <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.8. <hi>It ſhall come to paſs in that day, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, that I will break his Yoke from off thy neck, and burst thy bonds.</hi> And accordingly the Church here calls her preſent affliction and miſery by reaſon of her captived ſtate, a <hi>Yoke,</hi> Lam. 1.14. <hi>The yoke of my tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is bound by his hand. [The yoke of my tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions]</hi> that is, the puniſhment procured by my tranſgreſſions; as if he ſhould ſay, God hath laid upon me a heavy <hi>Yoke</hi> of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction as the juſt reward of my ſin.</p>
               <p>Now this is a <hi>Yoke</hi> that it is good for a man to bear in his youth. Afflictions have in them matter of real advantage. This ſeems a Paradox to ſenſe; and no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for even good men can hardly make ſenſe of it. Therefore let us a little en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,</p>
               <p>In what ſenſe afflictions are good, and</p>
               <p>For whom they are good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. In what ſence are afflictions good?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> They are not good in themſelves, they are not <hi>bona,</hi> though they may work <hi>in bonum;</hi> they are not good things, though they may work to good ends.</p>
               <p>In their own nature they are evil, and ſo called in Scripture, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.6. <hi>Is there any evil in the City, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:63179:21"/>
Iſai. 45.7. <hi>I make peace, and create evil, I the Lord do all theſe things.</hi> Mic. 1.12. <hi>The inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good, but evil came down from the Lord unto the Gate of Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which is a fruit of ſin, a part of the curſe, introduced upon the breach of the firſt Covenant, muſt needs be in it ſelf evil. But ſo is affliction. It is evil in it ſelf, and evil to the Creature, evil in its nature, and evil in its tendency. But yet as afflictions are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and directed by God, and under the management of his Spirit, ſo they are good, they ſerve to good purpoſes.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall give a more diſtinct Anſwer to the Queſtion in four gradual Concluſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Nothing Man miſtakes more about than <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Concl. </seg>1</label> the matter of <hi>good.</hi> This is moſt evident from the differing opinions of the Ancients about it;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Auſtin</hi> rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons up 288.</note> which all ſhew that man is acted herein very much by fancy and preſent appearances: inſomuch that if God ſhould give a man his own <hi>wiſh,</hi> he would ruine himſelf with <hi>evil</hi> under the ſhew of <hi>good. Brine</hi> preſerves ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things which would rot in <hi>Sugar,</hi> and yet ſenſe is all for pleaſing the <hi>ſweet tooth.</hi> But no wiſe Body will give a ſick man what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, but what the Phyſician directs. As God ſometimes in judgment pleaſes a man to his ruine, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.15. <hi>He gave them their requeſt, but ſent leanneſs into their ſouls.</hi>) So he ſometimes in mercy croſſes him to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. We are ſhort ſighted, and diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with paſſions; and therefore call that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63179:22"/>
                  <hi>good</hi> which would be our bane, and deprecate that as evil which would be a real benefit.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſs, <hi>Joſeph</hi> could not but regret at, and (being a good Youth) pray againſt his Brethrens unnatural cruelty, as having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it in appearance but evil and vaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage. What? for a young Stripling to be fold for a Slave? to be barter'd away out of his Father's boſome into a ſtrange Country, never like to be heard of more? then caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Priſon, and expoſed to all ſeverities? Can there be any good in this? Senſe and opinion ſay no: But pray conſider, How had he been raiſed to ſuch a price, if he had not been firſt made ſo cheap? how had he been made a <hi>Prince</hi> by Strangers, if he had not been made a <hi>Slave</hi> by his Brethren? nay, how many had periſhed for bread, had not he been ſent for merchandiſe into <hi>Egypt?</hi> So <hi>Joſeph</hi> afterwards acknowledges, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.5. <hi>Ye ſold me hither, but God ſent me before you to preſerve life.</hi> And <hi>Gen.</hi> 50.20. <hi>As for you, ye thought evil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, but God meant it unto good, to bring to paſs as it is this day, to ſave much people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God many times takes away for our good, ſtrips us for our advantage, caſts us down, and ſeemingly caſts us off, and all for our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit. Opinion ſays, with old <hi>Jacob, All theſe things are againſt me,</hi> Gen. 42.36. and yet they were all for him; and therefore</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Concl. </seg>2</label>
                  <hi>Good</hi> is to be eſtimated, not by its ſuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſenſe, but by its reference to the ſoul. That is the trueſt <hi>good</hi> which promotes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63179:22"/>
of the better part; no mans condition can be made good by any outward circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, while the caſe of his ſoul is deſperate; for that is the better part of us: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore good men have always valued themſelves more upon their inward indowments, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny outward acquiſitions; and have ſet more ſtore by a Dram of Grace, than by all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comforts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Good</hi> is to be judged by its conducency to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Concl. </seg>3</label> the <hi>chief good.</hi> God is the <hi>chief good,</hi> and our chief good is in the enjoyment of him; and therefore whatever tends to the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of our enjoyment of God, that is to be reckoned as good, be it in it ſelf pleaſant or ungrateful, ſweet or bitter. For as nothing is <hi>good,</hi> but what is from the <hi>chief good;</hi> ſo nothing is ſo, but what conduces to the fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him: and therefore</p>
               <p>That may be <hi>good</hi> in its uſe which is not <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Concl. </seg>4</label> 
                  <hi>good</hi> in its nature. Afflictions may be regret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the fleſh, becauſe of preſent ſmart; but they may be very conducing to the ſoul, becauſe of after benefit. <hi>No affliction at the preſent ſeems to be joyous, but grievous; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs afterward it yields the peaceable fruits of righteouſneſs to them which are exerciſed thereby, Heb.</hi> 12.11.</p>
               <p>The end puts a lovelineſs into thoſe means which otherwiſe have no lovelineſs in them. Thus you launch a part to eaſe the whole, and cut off a limb to preſerve life. We are not ſo much to conſider what things are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as what they are in their tendency and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63179:23"/>
end; Phyſick muſt have time to work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. For whom are afflictions good?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Text anſwers the Queſtion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely, and an indefinite is of the nature of an univerſal, <hi>It is good for a man]</hi> that is, for every man: all men come under one of theſe denominations they are either good or evil, now afflictions are <hi>good</hi> for both.</p>
               <p>Firſt, They are <hi>good</hi> for a good man, or elſe God would never lay good men under them; but we ſee them that lye neareſt to his heart to be moſt under this <hi>Yoke. God gave to Eſau Mount Seir to poſſeſs it, but Jacob and his Chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren went down into Egypt,</hi> Joſh. 24.4. and yet <hi>Jacob</hi> was loved, and <hi>Eſau</hi> hated, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.2, 3. <hi>The good Figs</hi> were <hi>ſent into the Land of Chaldea for their good,</hi> Jer. 24.5. <hi>He for our profit,</hi> Heb. 12.10. This <hi>Yoke</hi> is not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable but neceſſary, and it is the wiſdom of God to ſuit his Providence to our neceſſities <hi>For a ſeaſon ye are in heaveneſs, if need be,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6. Not elſe. A tender Father doth not uſe the Rod, but when there is need; he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides with delight, but he puniſhes with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret. God hath a <hi>treaſure of mercy,</hi> and a <hi>treaſure of wrath,</hi> the <hi>treaſure of mercy</hi> is of his own filling, but the <hi>treaſure of wrath</hi> is of our filling; and therefore we are ſaid to <hi>treaſure up to our ſelves wrath againſt the day of wrath,</hi> Rom. 2.5. that is, by our ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God.</p>
               <p>There is more or leſs of all ſin, where yet the work of converſion is really wrought. There is much luſt to be mortified, pride to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63179:23"/>
be ſubdued, the World to be crucified, the will to be made more docile and reſigned, the affections to be weaned, many remains of ſin to be purged out; and this God doth by affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. <hi>By this ſhall the iniquity of Jacob be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and this is all the fruit to take away his ſin,</hi> Iſai. 27.9. He brings them into deep waters, not to drown them, but to cleanſe them. Gold is not caſt into the fire to be conſumed, but to be refined; ſo that the fire takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from it but the droſs. Nor doth afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on take any thing from a good man but his ſin.</p>
               <p>And as it is neceſſary for the purging out of ſin, ſo it is for the exerciſing and improving of Grace; it is <hi>a Fining-Pot to faith,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.7.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Promoter of humility,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.17.</p>
               <p>The <hi>incentive to godly fear,</hi> Pſal. 55.19.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Worker of patience,</hi> Rom. 5.8.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Rack for confeſſion of ſin,</hi> Pſal. 32.4, 5.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Goad to repentance,</hi> Jer. 31.18.</p>
               <p>A <hi>School of obedience,</hi> Heb. 5.8.</p>
               <p>An <hi>improvement of all holineſs,</hi> Heb. 12.10.</p>
               <p>Thus what the outward man loſes, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man gets; if he be ſtraitned in the Fleſh, he is enlarged in the Spirit. It is ſaid of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that <hi>the more they were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, the more they multiplied and grew,</hi> Exod. 1.12. And ſo doth Grace in every good man, it grows by affliction. When the <hi>North Wind</hi> blows upon the <hi>Garden</hi> of the Spouſe, then her <hi>Spices flow forth,</hi> Cant. 4.16. The biggeſt Fiſh are in the ſalt Waters and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:63179:24"/>
they are the moſt growing Chriſtians that are moſt in the ſalt Waters of affliction.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Afflictions are good for carnal and unconverted men, and that many ways.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> They many times obviate thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils which, through the corruption of our natures, are occaſioned by worldly proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Good men are many times made worſe by outward ſucceſſes, and therefore no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if evil men are ſo much more. <hi>Let favour be ſhewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> Iſai. 26.10.</p>
               <p>Outward proſperity cauſes great indulgence to the Fleſh, which is an utter enemy to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. The beginning of all obedience is the mortifying the Fleſh, which no natural man can endure, eſpecially when nouriſhed by eaſe and proſperity; for then reaſon is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly drowned in ſenſe, and judgment extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed in appetite.</p>
               <p>It tempts a man to take up his reſt in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent comforts, like the Children of <hi>Reuben</hi> and <hi>Gad,</hi> who when they found the Land of <hi>Gilead</hi> was a place for Cattel, <hi>Numb.</hi> 32.1. they ſue to <hi>Moſes</hi> that that may be their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>This Land is a Land for Cattel, and thy Servants have Cattel; wherefore, ſay they, if we have found Grace in thy ſight, let this Land be given to thy Servants for a poſſeſſion, and bring us not over Jordan,</hi> ver. 4, 5. Though <hi>Canaan</hi> was the promiſed Land, and the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing lay in a Portion there, yet they deſire to take up on this ſide <hi>Jordan,</hi> without ſeeking ought in the Land of promiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:63179:24"/>It hinders our enquiries after God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a temptation to ſet light by him and his Precepts. <hi>Job,</hi> ſpeaking of the proſperity of the wicked, makes this the ſad effect of it, <hi>Therefore they ſay unto God, Depart from us, for we deſire not the knowledge of thy ways; what is the Almighty that we ſhould ſerve him? and what profit ſhould we have if we pray unto him?</hi> Job 21.14, 15.</p>
               <p>Nay, it provokes to down right Atheiſm. And this is the reaſon of <hi>Agars</hi> prayer againſt riches, <hi>Leſt I be full and deny thee, and ſay, Who is the Lord?</hi> Prov. 30.9. Thus <hi>the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of fools deſtroys them,</hi> Prov. 1.32.</p>
               <p>It puffs up the heart with pride and ſcorn. <hi>They are not in trouble as other men, neither are they plagued like other men; therefore pride com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth them about as a Chain,</hi> Pſal. 73.5, 6.</p>
               <p>Now theſe and ſuch like miſchiefs are often remedied by early affliction. By being inured to wants and abatements, we are made to ſee the emptineſs of the Creatures, what lying vanities they are. The ſoul is hereby put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeeking after God, <hi>In their afflictions they will ſeek me early,</hi> Hoſ. 5.15. By this means the ſoul is debaſed and laid low. And this the Holy Ghoſt makes to be one fruit of early bearing the <hi>Yoke,</hi> in the next Verſes to the Text, <hi>He ſitteth alone and keepeth ſilence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath born it upon him. He putteth his mouth in the dust,</hi> Lamen. 3.28, 29.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Affliction is inlightening. It is good for diſcovery. There are many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Leſſons learned in the School of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:63179:25"/>1. It diſcovers a man to himſelf, and makes him ſee what a poor, frail, inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable thing he is, according to that of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 9.20. <hi>Put them in fear, O Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>that they may know themſelves to be but men.</hi> To be but <hi>enoſh,</hi> poor, weak and miſerable men. Affliction makes us know our ſelves. <hi>Caligula</hi> and <hi>Domitian</hi> (two <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours) in their proſperity would be <hi>Gods;</hi> but when it thundred, they were ſo terrified, that then they knew they were but men. Proſperity makes a man a Stranger to himſelf; no man knows that pride, that impatience, that luſt, that unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that frowardneſs, that is in his heart till affliction comes to ſearch him. <hi>God led Iſrael forty years in the Wilderneſs to know what was in their hearts,</hi> that is, to make them know, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a means to diſcover the vileneſs of ſin to the ſoul. When the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> were diſtreſſed and in adverſity, then they ſaw (and never till then) the greatneſs of their ſin in ſelling their Brother, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.21. <hi>If they be bound in Fetters, and holden in Cords of affliction, then he ſhews them their work and their tranſgreſſions that they have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,</hi> Job 36.8, 9. Nothing diſcovers the vileneſs of ſin more than the ſufferings of Chriſt, and the afflictions of the Creature.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God by affliction diſcovers himſelf to the ſoul. In the Word we hear of God, but in affliction we ſee him, <hi>I have heard of thee</hi> (ſays <hi>Job) by the hearing of the ear, but now
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63179:25"/>
mine eye ſees thee,</hi> Job 42.5. It is ſaid of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.13. <hi>Then Manaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeh knew that the Lord he was God. Then!</hi> When was that? When he was caught a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Thorns, and bound with Fetters, and carried to <hi>Babylon,</hi> till then he knew not the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Affliction is <hi>good</hi> as it is prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to Grace and Converſion. What excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Veſſels have been formed by the hand of the <hi>Former of all things</hi> in the Furnace of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions! It is preparatory to converſion ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that it makes us more ſerious. When we are out of the noiſe of worldly allurements, then conſcience is apt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect and make us bethink our ſelves. <hi>If they ſhall bethink themſelves in the Land whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are carried captive,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 8.47. When was it that the <hi>Prodigal</hi> came to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but when he was pinched and almoſt pined with Famine, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.16, 17.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a means to reduce our wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Man is a ſtragling Creature, very prone to wander from God and loſe himſelf. He is never weary of following his ſins till God hedges up his way with Thorns. God hath two Hedges which the Scripture men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hedge of protection,</hi> Job 1.10. Iſai. 5.5. and</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hedge of affliction,</hi> Hoſ. 2.6. <hi>I will hedge up her way with Thorns.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Hedge</hi> of <hi>protection</hi> is to keep his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63179:26"/>
from danger, the <hi>Hedge</hi> of <hi>affliction</hi> is to ſtop them that wander. The one is to fence his people from ſuffering, the other is to ſtop Sinners in the way of ſinning, and to put them upon returning. So when God had hedged up <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s way with Thorns, then She reſolves to return, <hi>I will return to my firſt Husband, for then was it better with me than now,</hi> Hoſ. 2.6, 7.</p>

Pride, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, unbelief, impenitency, love of ſin, prejudices and ſenſual delights, are the Ear-Wax that ſo ſtop the Sinners ear that <hi>he will not hear the voice of the Charmer, charm he never ſo wiſely,</hi> Pſal. 58.5.

               <argument>
                  <p>Shewing the difference between the Yoke of the Spirit and the Yoke of Chriſt. What the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits Yoke is. Why convictions are compared to a Yoke. Why Sinners muſt come under the Yoke of the Spirit. Why it is good to come under it betimes.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE next ſenſe in which I am to ſpeak of this <hi>Yoke</hi> is that of <hi>conviction of ſin,</hi> to make way to the laſt Notion of it which more eſpecially deſign to inſiſt upon, and that is the <hi>Yoke of Goſpel obedience and ſubjection,</hi> the one is the <hi>Yoke of the Spirit,</hi> the other is the <hi>Yoke of Chriſt.</hi> Theſe two are not the ſame, but very different <hi>Yokes,</hi> eſpecially in theſe four things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, The <hi>Yoke</hi> of the Spirit is grievous, the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt is not grievous, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.3. the <hi>Yoke</hi> of the Spirit is very heavy, the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt is very light, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.30.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is the heavineſs of the Spirits <hi>Yoke</hi> which makes Chriſt's <hi>Yoke</hi> eaſie. It is not eaſie to all; no, they that never felt the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits <hi>Yoke,</hi> to them Chriſt's <hi>Yoke</hi> is a burthen And therefore when Chriſt ſays, <hi>My Yoke is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,</hi> it points to them whom he calls to come and take it up; and who are they? Why, <hi>the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy laden and weary,</hi> ver. 28. They who are wearied by the Spirits <hi>Yoke,</hi> ſhall thereby find eaſe under Chriſt's <hi>Yoke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Yoke</hi> of the Spirit is but for a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63179:28"/>
time, and then to be taken off, and never put on again; but the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt is always to be kept on, never to be put off; the ſoul is under a perpetual obligation to Duty and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The <hi>Yoke</hi> of the Spirit is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare us for the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt; for Chriſt's <hi>Yoke</hi> can never be put on, till the Spirit by his <hi>Yoke</hi> hath fitted the neck for it. The ſoul will never obey Chriſt till it be conquered to Chriſt, and that will never be till the Spirit in convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction put his <hi>Yoke</hi> and Fetters upon it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now ſpeak ſomewhat of the Spirits <hi>Yoke;</hi> and if ever the Lord give ſuch another Call to this Work, then I ſhall ſpeak of Chriſt's <hi>Yoke</hi> more largely. And in ſpeaking of the <hi>Yoke</hi> of the Spirit in conviction, I would inſiſt a little upon theſe four things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the Spirit hath his <hi>Yoke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Why the convictions of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon the ſoul of a Sinner are compared to a <hi>Yoke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Every Sinner that ſhall be ſaved muſt come under this <hi>Yoke</hi> of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Therefore it is good to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it betimes, and why?</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the Spirit hath his <hi>Yoke.</hi> There is ſuch a thing upon the conſciences of Sinners at one time or other as the <hi>Yoke</hi> of the Spirit. As the Spirit hath his joys and comforts, ſo he hath his <hi>Yokes</hi> and Bonds; as he hath a <hi>liberty</hi> which he brings ſome <hi>into,</hi> ſo he hath a <hi>thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> which he brings ſome <hi>under.</hi> And it is firſt <hi>bondage,</hi> and then <hi>liberty.</hi> He is a <hi>Spirit
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63179:29"/>
of liberty</hi> to none, but to whom he is firſt a <hi>Spirit of bondage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits Yoke deſcribed.</note>And if you ask me, What this <hi>Yoke</hi> of the Spirit is? It is that ſtate he brings the Sinner into, and holds him in, before his converſion, to prepare him for his converſion; and that is a ſtate of ſenſibleneſs of ſin and wrath, which flows from the convincing work of the Spirit. The Spirit of the Lord, whereever he comes to work a ſaving change, doth firſt put his <hi>Yoke</hi> upon the Sinners neck; that is, he doth convince the ſoul of the evil of ſin, and of its liableneſs to the wrath of God, and ſo fills it with fear and horrour; ſo that the poor Creature looks upon it ſelf as utterly loſt and undone ſo long as it abides in that ſtate. This is the Spirits <hi>Yoke:</hi> It is called ſo in Scripture, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.14. <hi>The Yoke of my tranſgreſſions is bound by his hand, they are wreathed and come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my neck; the Lord hath delivered me into their hands from whom I am not able to riſe up. Into their hands,</hi> that is, into the hands of ſin, and ſhe was not able to riſe up from under them,<note place="margin">Prov. 5.22.</note> and why? Becauſe the Spirit had bound them upon her as a <hi>Yoke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Why are the convictions of the Spirit compared to a <hi>Yoke?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> A <hi>Yoke</hi> is very heavy and burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. So is ſin when once the conſcience is truly convinced of it, <hi>Mine inquities are gone over mine head, as an heavy burthen they are too heavy for me,</hi> Pſal. 38.4. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a ſoul under the ſenſe of ſin is ſaid to be heavy laden, <hi>Matth</hi> 11.28.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:63179:29"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> A <hi>Yoke</hi> bows the Back by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its weight. Hence is that expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the kindneſs of God to <hi>Iſrael, Lev.</hi> 26.13. <hi>I have broken the Bonds of your Yoke, and made you go upright;</hi> implying that the <hi>Yoke</hi> cauſes a man to bow and ſtoop under it; ſo doth conviction of ſin, it bows the ſoul under it, <hi>I am troubled, I am bowed down greatly, I go mourning all the day long, Pſal.</hi> 38.6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A <hi>Yoke</hi> is a galling, wounding thing; ſo is conviction: O how it wounds with the ſenſe of ſin, and dread of wrath,<note place="margin">Prov. 18.14.</note> and <hi>a wounded Spirit who can bear?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Foarthly,</hi> A <hi>Yoke</hi> is a taming thing. It tames the wildeſt Beaſt; ſo conviction tames the moſt unruly Sinner, though he be never ſo raging in his luſts, yet when the Spirit of God doth but ſet ſin cloſe to the conſcience; O how pliable is he! So it was with <hi>Saul,</hi> he breathed nothing but <hi>threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and ſlaughter againſt the Diſciples of the Lord,</hi> Acts 9.1. but Chriſt no ſooner ſmites him with a word from Heaven, but how tame and pliable is he! <hi>He trembling and aſtoniſhed ſaid, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> v. 6. And hence the convictions of the Spirit are fitly compared to a <hi>Yoke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Every Sinner that ever ſhall be ſaved muſt come under this <hi>Yoke</hi> of the Spirit, he muſt be brought to a conviction of his loſt eſtate. There is a neceſſity for this, and I will ſhew you why?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:63179:30"/>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe it is eſſential to ſound converſion. What is converſion but a turning from ſin to God? and how can a man turn from ſin without a true ſenſe of ſin? or how can he turn to God till he be made to ſee and feel the want of God? therefore it is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. It is the conſtant method of God with all that are capable of the work. Firſt, He ſhews man his ſin, then his Saviour; firſt his wound, then his cure; firſt his malady, then his remedy; firſt his danger, then his Redeemer.<note place="margin">Gen. 3.10, 15.</note> Thus God began with <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> he firſt opens their eyes to ſee their ſin and miſery, their nakedneſs and ſhame, and then makes them a promiſe of the ſeed of the Woman.

               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. The ſoul lyes under no promiſe of good from Chriſt, till it come under the <hi>Yoke</hi> of the Spirit. Then it is ſenſible of ſin, and ſenſible Sinners lye under the promiſe of Chriſt. There is not one promiſe in all the Goſpel made of Chriſt to a Sinner, as he is a Sinner; if there were, it would be in vain. For, as ſuch, he could not receive it, nor can it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to him, for he is under another Covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 5. Without this he can never ſet a true eſtimate upon the blood and Grace of Jeſus Chriſt. The Pearl of Pardoning Grace ſhall never be caſt before Swine that wallow in their ſins. Though Chriſt be free of his bloud, yet we ſhall ſee the want of it before we have it, that we may know the worth of it when we enjoy it. He diſcovers himſelf in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63179:31"/>
ſuch a way as the Sinner may prize him moſt; and when is that, but when ſin lyes with the greateſt load upon conſcience? When the <hi>Yoke</hi> of the Spirit is heavieſt, then redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Chriſt is ſweeteſt. When he ſees his Caſe at worſt, then he prizes Chriſt moſt. When he is made to know how wretched his ſtate is, then he conſiders how precious the bloud of Chriſt is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 6. Till the ſoul comes to bear the <hi>Yoke</hi> of the Spirit, it can never be brought to cloſe with Chriſt upon Goſpel terms. It is ſenſe of ſin and miſery that muſt bow the ſoul to Gods conditions of mercy. The reaſon why ſo many Sinners periſh under the Call of Chriſt, is not becauſe they totally reject him, but becauſe they don't make a right cloſe with him; they don't come up to God's terms. There are ſtated Conditions which every one that would have Chriſt, and benefit by Chriſt, muſt come up to; and what are they? Why, he that would have Chriſt, muſt have whole Chriſt, Chriſt in all his Offices, not only as Prieſt, but as King and Prophet. And this neceſſarily ſupoſes a renouncing all ſin and luſt, a reſolute owning and adhering to his Truths and Ordinances, and an unfeigned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of heart and ſoul to his will in all things. This is the right receiving of Chriſt. Now there are but few that can come up to this; they would have Chriſt, but they would not part with their luſts; they would have a juſtifying Chriſt, but not a ſanctifying Chriſt; a Chriſt to pardon and ſave them,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63179:31"/>
but not to purge and cleanſe them. There is ſuch a cloſe League between the natural man and his luſt, that till conſcience be convinced, and ſin imbittered, the ſoul will not be divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; and ſo long Chriſt can't be received: therefore there is a neceſſity that every Sinner that would be ſaved, ſhould come under the Spirits <hi>Yoke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is good to come under the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits <hi>Yoke</hi> betimes, to bear the <hi>Yoke</hi> in a mans Youth. <hi>A mans Youth</hi> may have a twofold reſpect, either to the earlineſs of profeſſion, or to the earlineſs of being.</p>

It is good to bear the <hi>Yoke</hi> of conviction in the <hi>Youth</hi> of our profeſſion: For that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Religion that is not founded in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of ſin, will never hold out; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not laſt long; it is <hi>Seed ſown in ſtony ground,</hi> which though it may ſpring up for a while, yet when tribulation or perſecution comes, becauſe of the word, it will wither away for want of depth of Earth to take root in, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.20, 21. It is good therefore to found an early profeſſion in ſound convictions.</p>

The longer thou continueſt in ſin, the harder it will be to bear repentance. If thy conſcience be ſo charged with guilt, that thou dareſt not look into it at ten or twenty years old, what will it come to if thou letteſt it run on till fifty or ſixty. The longer the Debt ſtands in the Book, the heavier the account when we come to reckon for all the arrears of ſo many years actual ſins, added to the grand Debt of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſin.

Think how often the Spirits motions were ſlighted, his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels ſet at nought, his ſtrivings reſiſted. Think how often he knocked, how loud he called, before he could be heard; think how much unbelief, how many confederacies with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, what ſtrong luſts, what enmity to God and holineſs, lay in the way to obſtruct the Spirits deſign. O what a mighty power
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:63179:34"/>
did he put forth to make ſin a burthen, and to faſten his Fetters upon the ſoul, without which thy reſiſtances had never been conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor thy <hi>thoughts</hi> brought <hi>into captivity to the obedience of Chriſt.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10.5.</note> And haſt thou not cauſe to be thankful?</p>
               <p n="2">2. How many miſcarry under the ſame convictions which have iſſued in a ſincere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to thy ſoul. Many by their ſights of ſin and Hell have been driven into utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, as <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Spira.</hi> Many have laid vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent hands on their own lives, as <hi>Judas;</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have ſtifled, and ſinned away their convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and thereby have provoked the Spirit finally to withdraw, and give them up to hardneſs of heart; many have miſtaken their convictions for converſion, reſting in them, and ſo periſhing <hi>in the place of the breaking forth of children.</hi>

O what mercy is this! While ſome deſpair and others preſume, thou art brought by a ſight of ſin to cloſe with Chriſt upon Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel terms. And haſt thou not cauſe to be thankful?</p>
               <p n="3">3. This <hi>Yoke</hi> of the Spirit being once ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, ſhall never be put on again; thou ſhalt never come under it more: Doth not the Scripture ſay as much, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. <hi>Ye have not received the ſpirit of bondage again to fear.</hi> In whomſoever the <hi>ſpirit of bondage</hi> once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:63179:34"/>
a <hi>ſpirit of adoption</hi> he is never a <hi>spirit of bondage</hi> more in that ſoul. If after he hath once ſealed our <hi>adoption</hi> to us, he ſhould again impreſs fears of eternal wrath upon us, he would herein be contrary to himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But are not many of the Children of God, after Grace wrought, full of fears and apprehenſions of Hell and wrath?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We muſt diſtinguiſh between bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage by <hi>deſertion,</hi> and bondage by the Spirit in <hi>conviction.</hi> A Believer under deſertion may be in bondage by his own ſpirit, but not by the ſpirit of God. When God doth ſuſpend the wonted influences of Grace and comfort, a mans own conſcience may fill him with fears of Hell and dread of wrath; but this is not from the ſuggeſtions of Gods ſpirit, but from the miſtake of his own. He can never be a ſpirit of bondage more. And is not this cauſe of thankfulneſs?</p>
               <p n="4">4. How great the advantage is that comes by complying with, and yielding to the ſpirit in convincing work. For where he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with in the beginning, he carries it on to perfection. If he convinces of ſin and the ſoul fall under it by humiliation and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, he will convince of righteouſneſs too, and ſo raiſe it up again by faith and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. Nay, by an early compliance with the ſtrivings of the ſpirit when he firſt comes to diſcover to thee thy loſt eſtate, thou haſt ſecured his preſence for ever, and he ſhall carry on this work of conviction ſo long as there is any one luſt remaining. A Believer
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:63179:35"/>
hath need of the convictions of the ſpirit ſo long as he lives. It is a miſtake to think the convincing work of the Spirit is over when it hath diſcovered to a man his loſt eſtate, and ſo brought him to a cloſe with Chriſt; there is a great deal of convincing work yet to be done; as there is a <hi>ſinful eſtate,</hi> ſo there is a <hi>ſinful frame</hi> of heart. Now though the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever can no more need the convictions of the Spirit as to the former (for his eſtate is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged) yet he always needs them as to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Though he was convinced of the filthy nature and damning conſequences of ſin to prepare him for Chriſt and converſion, yet there are convictions of neceſſary uſe to the carrying on and compleating the work of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification.</p>
               <p>There is a great <hi>deceitfulneſs</hi> in ſin, more than the Believer ever yet ſaw; and therefore he wants conviction of that. There is a great <hi>power</hi> in remaining luſts to draw the heart from Chriſt, he wants further conviction of that. There is a gradual, <hi>ſecret hardening of heart</hi> which in-dwelling ſin works to even in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, he wants further conviction of that. Nay, how many <hi>ſecret, ſpiritual luſts,</hi> hidden and cloſe corruptions are there in the heart, which at firſt entrance into a ſtate of Grace the Believer never ſaw, they lye in the heart undiſcerned till the Spirit comes in with fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther light. So that a Believer always needs the convincing work of the Spirit, it is eſſentially neceſſary to the perfecting of Grace and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Now he that yields to the convictions
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:63179:35"/>
of the Spirit at firſt, doth thereby ſecure them to the laſt. He ſhall never ceaſe enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſtriving, counſelling, ſo long as there is any one luſt remaining. His influences ſhall abide till he hath got the maſtery of every ſin, and <hi>judgment</hi> be <hi>ſent forth to victory</hi> over every corruption. <hi>He dwelleth with you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 12.20.</note> 
                  <hi>and ſhall be in you,</hi> John 14.17. O what cauſe of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs have ſuch as have born the Spirits <hi>Yoke</hi> with ſucceſs!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Your Duty is to be <hi>humble.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member your Bonds; ſo doth the Church, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.19, 20. <hi>Remembring mine affliction and my miſery, the Wormwood and the Gall, my ſoul hath them ſtill in remembrance, and is humbled in me.</hi> One excellent means to cure ſpiritual pride is to look often back to the days of your ſoul diſtreſſes: therefore God when his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were ſettled in the <hi>promiſed Land,</hi> often remembers them of their <hi>wilderneſs ſtate,</hi> that they might not pride themſelves in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent poſſeſſions, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.2. <hi>Thou ſhalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee in the Wilderneſs to humble thee.</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>He humbled thee, and ſuffered thee to hunger.</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 14, 15. <hi>Beware leſt thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy God, who led thee through that great and terrible wilderneſs, wherein were fiery Serpents, and Scorpions, and drought, where there was no water—that he might humble thee.</hi> No man will be lifted up under his preſent mercies, that doth but ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and frequently reflect upon his loſt eſtate and the means and manner of his deliverance.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:63179:36"/>
O think often of the ſighs and ſorrows, the tears and terrours, the griefs and groans of thy ſinking Spirit in the Day when the <hi>Arrows of God</hi> ſtuck there: How long thou haſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly lain at God's foot, begging for one Drop of the bloud of Chriſt to pardon ſin, one Dram of Grace to ſecure thy Eſtate, one glympſe of comfort to refreſh thy wearied and heavy laden ſpirit; and then be proud if thou canſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Labour to be <hi>fruitful.</hi> This is the great end of the Spirit in all his convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. He convinceth of <hi>ſin,</hi> to break off the Sinner from it; he convinceth of <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> that the Sinner may ſeek after it; and he convinces of the neceſſity of <hi>holineſs,</hi> that he may get it and grow up in it: ſo that ye ſin againſt, and fruſtrate the whole deſign of the Holy Ghoſt in his work in the heart without this. For ye are therefore <hi>made free from ſin, and become ſervants to God,</hi> that ye might <hi>have your fruit unto holineſs,</hi> Rom. 6.22. And the ſame Apoſtle tells you (cap. 7.4) <hi>Ye are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come dead to the Law by the Body of Chriſt, that ye ſhould be married to another, even to him who is raiſed from the dead, that ye ſhould bring forth fruit to God.</hi> Labour therefore to be fruitful, for this is that which ſecures the Spirits influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to your great advantage, <hi>Every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit,</hi> John 15.2.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This Doctrine affords matter of counſel to ſuch as never were under the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits <hi>Yoke.</hi> I would commend to ſuch three things eſpecially.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:63179:36"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Be perſwaded of the neceſſity of a true and ſound converſion. Think often of what Chriſt ſo ſolemnly averreth, <hi>John.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God.</hi> And in order to this, think ſeriouſly what a miſerable ſtate an unconverted ſtate is: It is a ſtate of enmity to God, it is a ſtate wherein all the guilt of all the ſins that ever you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted (the leaſt whereof deſerves Hell) lyes upon the ſoul, and binds it over to eternal damnation. It is a ſtate wherein the bloud and righteouſneſs of Chriſt cannot avail us, for he pardons none whom he doth not change and convert,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.6.</note> 
                  <hi>he comes</hi> (whereever he comes) <hi>by bloud and water.</hi> It is a ſtate which mingles a curſe with all your bleſſings, <hi>To the unbeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving is nothing pure.</hi> It is a ſtate of death, for every unconverted Sinner is ſpiritually dead, he cannot do any one act that is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually good. It is a ſtate wherein the Sinner is not only liable to damnation as an Heir of Hell, but he is <hi>condemned already,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 3.18, 36.</note> the Law condemns him though the final Sentence be not yet paſſed upon him; and if he dyes in that ſtate (without a real converſion) God will moſt certainly judge as the Law judgeth; ſo that he is as ſure to be damned as ever he was born. And all this the Word of God plainly atteſts. And is not there a neceſſity of a ſound converſion? Is ſuch a ſtate as this, a ſtate to be reſted in? No, not for a day,<note place="margin">Gen. 19.15, 17.</note> 
                  <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, eſcape for thy life—leſt thou be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:63179:37"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Hearken no longer to the Devils ſuggeſtions and counſels; his great deſign is to keep thee ſecure in a carnal condition, to ward off all ſerious thoughts of ſpiritual and eternal concernment: and he hath innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble methods and devices for the carrying on of this deſign. Sometimes by faſcination of the ſenſes with carnal pleaſures, ſometimes by incumbring the mind with worldly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; (as in <hi>Luke</hi> 14.18, 19, 20.) ſo that we have no leiſure for God and our ſouls. How often doth the Spirit knock, but cannot be heard! how loud doth he call, but receives no Anſwer! how freely hath he tendred his counſels,<note place="margin">Prov. 1.25.</note> but they have been ſet at nought! Satan by the noiſe of bewitching pleaſures, or incumbring cares, makes the Sinner turn a deaf ear to all the Spirits calls and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</p>
               <p>Or if the Sinner do at any time bethink himſelf of his ſoul and ſalvation, then he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to perſwade him there is no danger, he is ſecure as to that by what Chriſt hath done and ſuffered for him; if he doth ſin, ſo do the beſt that live; and if he begs forgiveneſs, God is full of mercy. Thus he keeps men from repentance and ſalvation, by perſwading them they are ſafe already; and if he can but hide their danger from them, (which he indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly endeavours to do) he knows he hath them faſt enough: For who will mind the Phyſician, that knows of no diſeaſe he hath? who will think of turning back that concludes he is in the right way? who will ſtoop to the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:63179:37"/>
convictions of the Spirit that is perſwaded his ſins are pardoned, and his condition ſafe? Thus as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> put out <hi>Zedechiah</hi>'s eyes, and carried him captive to <hi>Babylon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 39.7.</note> ſo doth Satan blind Sinners to their eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Do what in you lies to come under the convictions of the Spirit. As you value your ſouls, and would have the way of the Lord prepared into your hearts, be willing to be made truly ſenſible what a loſt ſtate you are in. For you muſt know, that it is one thing to be a Sinner, it is another thing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of it; it is one thing to be loſt <hi>in our condition,</hi> it is another thing to be loſt <hi>in our apprehenſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a great difference between a <hi>ſtate of bondage,</hi> and <hi>a Spirit of bondage.</hi> Every Sinner is in a <hi>ſtate of bondage,</hi> but few come under <hi>the Spirit of bondage.</hi> The <hi>ſtate of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage</hi> is a great curſe, the <hi>Spirit of bondage</hi> may be a real bleſſing: for the <hi>Spirit of bondage</hi> is to deliver us out of a <hi>ſtate of bondage.</hi> It hath been ſo to thouſands, and therefore why not to thee? Therefore do what in you lyes to come under the convictions of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But have you not ſaid, that every Sinner is dead in ſin by nature? And if ſo, then what can a dead Sinner do to obtain the Spirit, and the convictions of the Spirit?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is ſomewhat in the order of means that men may do towards the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit of God. For though every
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:63179:38"/>
man in a natural ſtate is dead ſpiritually, and therefore can do no ſpiritual act; yet he can do the acts of that life he hath. He is a living man, though he be dead in ſins; and God commands us to <hi>ſhew our ſelves men:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſai. 46.8.</note> that is, by acting <hi>rationally,</hi> though we cannot act <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually.</hi> Though we cannot do any thing to compel the Spirit, becauſe he is free, yet we may uſe thoſe means in which God is wont to vouchſafe his Spirit. As for inſtance,</p>
               <p>Firſt, There is an attendance upon the Word preached. And this is the great Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God for the convincing and convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinners, the way by which the Spirit doth ordinarily work upon the ſouls of men. Though he is not tyed to means, yet God hath appointed them, and he will put honour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own appointments. How many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands <hi>were pricked in their hearts,</hi> and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced to converſion by that Sermon of <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 2.37. How was <hi>Lydia</hi> converted, but by <hi>attending to the things that were preached by Paul?</hi> Acts 16.14. Theſe <hi>weapons are mighty through God to the pulling down of ſtrong Holds,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the ſoul,</hi> Pſal. 19.7.</p>
               <p>Now this is every mans duty to attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Word, and there is no Sinner but is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do this as well as any other natural or moral action. Who is not as able to go to a Sermon as to a Play? And to frequent God's Houſe as well as a Drinking-Houſe? and to read God's Book as ſeriouſly as a News Book?</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is a diligent intention of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:63179:38"/>
mind to be exerciſed in attending on the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God, that we may underſtand and apply the things revealed as the counſel of God concerning us. And this every man that hath the uſe of reaſon is able to do. In other matters we can weigh things, and conſider them according to their weight and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and why not in things that concern our ſouls, and our everlaſting happineſs? Cannot a natural man reaſon thus? Either theſe truths of the Word of God ſignifie ſomething or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; if nothing, why hath the wiſe God ordained them to be thus earneſtly <hi>preſſed?</hi> If they do ſignifie any thing, why ſhould they be thus <hi>ſinfully ſleighted?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is a Duty to pray over what we hear, and to beg ſucceſs upon the Word for the ends whereto God ſends it. And is not this in the power of every natural man? There is no man of reaſon but hath praying abilities, many indeed have their excuſes, they cannot pray; but this is but to ſhift off Duty, and to excuſe one ſin by another. You never ſaw a hungry Beggar but could pray; nor a Child of five years old, but when the Rod is at his Back can pray; and cannot the Sinner cry to God? When you go to hear, can you not pray that God would <hi>open your eyes</hi> to <hi>ſee the wonders of his Law?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.18.</note> Cannot you beg of God that the Word may take hold of your heart, and pull down all the <hi>ſtrong Holds</hi> there? Can you not plead with him that he would ſend his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to accompany the Word to your heart, that ſin may be diſcovered, and your hard
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:63179:39"/>
heart broken, and that you may be made to ſee the need of Chriſt, and ſo brought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him for pardon and ſalvation? Theſe are no other than what every natural man hath power to perform, by the ſame aſſiſtance with which he lives and moves; and who knows what God may do in a way of Grace and mercy when the Sinner is found thus do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
               <p>I do not (dare not) ſay with the <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> That if we uſe our natural power to do our utmoſt, God is bound <hi>ex con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruo</hi> to give Grace; but yet this I may ſay, That ſuch is the goodneſs of God that he ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, if ever, fails to give Grace to that man that doth to the utmoſt of his abilities in the uſe of means endeavour to obtain it; nor had ever any cauſe to complain upon this account.</p>
               <p>And therefore let young ones hearken to this counſel, and as you love your ſouls do what in you lyes in the uſe of all Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed means to come under the Spirits <hi>Yoke.</hi> For conſider,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> You can never be brought from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Yoke</hi> of ſin and luſt, but by coming under this <hi>Yoke.</hi> Till you are <hi>weary</hi> of ſin, you will never <hi>forſake</hi> it, and you will never be <hi>weary</hi> of ſin till the <hi>Spirit of bondage</hi> hath made it a <hi>burthen</hi> to you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> You can never ſee the need you have of Jeſus Chriſt till you are brought under the <hi>Yoke</hi> of the Spirit; and till you do ſee your need of him, you will never hunger nor thirſt after him: and ſo you will be excluded from
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:63179:39"/>
all benefit by his righteouſneſs, and then you muſt periſh. For the Scripture diſcovers no way of eſcaping wrath to come, but by being convinced by the Holy Ghoſt firſt of ſin, and then of righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> You can never take upon you Chriſt's <hi>Yoke,</hi> which is the great command of the Goſpel,<note place="margin">Matth. 11.29.</note> unleſs you have been firſt under this. There is (as I ſaid before) the <hi>Yoke</hi> of the Spirit, and the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt, the <hi>Yoke</hi> of the Spirit is in conviction of ſin, the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt is in obedience, and the one is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory to the other; you can never ſubmit to Chriſts <hi>Yoke</hi> until the Spirits <hi>Yoke</hi> have fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the neck to it, and ſo it becomes eaſie, <hi>My Yoke is eaſie,</hi> Matth. 11.30. It is not eaſie to the ſinner that is at eaſe, but to the weary ſoul it is. Then any <hi>Yoke</hi> but the <hi>Yoke</hi> of luſt, any burthen to be delivered from the burthen of ſin and guilt. But who will walk in the <hi>narrow way</hi> that never entred in at the <hi>ſtrait Gate?</hi> Who will account ſubjection to Chriſt freedom, until he hath firſt been weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the ſlavery of ſins Dominion? And this is a fruit of the convincing work of the Spirit. And will you not come under his <hi>Yoke?</hi> But when? It muſt be done out of hand, delay in this matter is very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard of the indiſpoſition it works unto. The longer ſin hath poſſeſſion, the more it will ſtrengthen it ſelf, and harden the heart againſt conviction; and the harder the heart the greater the danger; for grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:63179:40"/>
hardneſs improves it ſelf into a judgment. Hardneſs perſiſted in provokes to hardening.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard of the uncertainty of our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Who knows how few hours there are between him and eternity? You that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the <hi>Yoke</hi> of the Spirit as a work fit for ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per years, 'pray what ſecurity have you for the number of your years? Hath God ſaid you ſhall not dye next ſickneſs, or next Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to Sea, or the next time you go to Bed, or walk abroad? An hundred dye young to one that lives long, and is it not then an hundred to one but you may? And how if you ſhould dye in an unconvinced and unconverted ſtate? Conſider what your eternal condition muſt then be. O be willing therefore to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this <hi>Yoke</hi> of the Spirit betimes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Here's matter of inſtruction to ſuch as are at preſent under the Spirits <hi>Yoke,</hi> made ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of ſin, and of their loſt ſtate, and cry out of Hell and wrath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Take heed of diſcouragement. To mourn under this condition, that is a duty; but to be diſcouraged and deſpond, that is a ſin: For it obſtructs the ſoul in that which is its duty, it benumns and weakens the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king hand. The Spirit of the Lord hath no hand in this, he ſets ſin home upon the heart to humble us and break us and lay us low; but not to bring us to diſcouragement and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, unleſs it be in our ſelves: and therefore that is the print of the Devils foot. It is one of his ſubtilties to rivet his temptations into our convictions. When the Spirit of the Lord
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:63179:40"/>
diſcovers ſin in its guilt and filth, to out us of our ſelves, and ſhew us our need of mercy, then he labours to ſink us down under the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of mercy: therefore let not thy ſenſe of ſin cauſe thee to draw falſe Concluſions, which in this Caſe is too common. For though thy Caſe be dark, it is not deſperate; though it is uncomfortable, it is not incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; though it is ſad, yet it is not ſingular. For,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> This is the way of God with all Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to whom he hath a purpoſe to ſhew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. The Wilderneſs is the way to the Land of promiſe, <hi>I will allure her, and bring her into the Wilderneſs, and there ſpeak comfortably to her,</hi> Hoſ. 2.14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This lays thee under the Promiſe. For that promiſes are not made to Sinners in their ſins, but to Sinners made ſenſible of their ſins; ſo that though thou art a <hi>Priſoner in a Pit where there is no water,</hi> Ezek. 9.11. yet thou art a <hi>Priſoner of hope,</hi> ver. 12. God invites ſuch as thou art, the tenders of Chriſt and Grace have a peculiar reſpect to thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This is that which <hi>prepares the way of the Lord</hi> into the heart. He comes not till the <hi>mountains</hi> be <hi>laid low,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 3.4 5.</note> and the <hi>way prepared</hi> for him, and nothing doth this like ſenſe of ſin, and ſight of a loſt eſtate: So that there is mercy even in being under the Spirits <hi>Yoke.</hi> And therefore,</p>
               <p>Secondly, Do not be unſenſible of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of being under the bondage of the Spirit.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:63179:41"/>
though it is not a Caſe that hath <hi>comfort</hi> in it, yet it is a Caſe that hath <hi>mercy</hi> in it. And no preſent miſery of any condition ſhould make us to overlook the mercy of that condition.</p>
               <p>You ſee ſin in its filthy nature and damning guilt, and thereupon are filled with dread and fear; and is not this a mercy? Though to <hi>do</hi> ſin is the moſt unprofitable work, yet to <hi>ſee</hi> ſin is the moſt profitable ſight. For ſo long as ſin is <hi>unſeen,</hi> Chriſt will be <hi>unſought.</hi> The reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is never deſired till our miſery be diſcerned and felt.</p>
               <p>Your conſcience is full of trouble, and you are weary, and cry out under the burthen of your ſoul-troubles; and is not this a mercy? How ſhall the burthen of ſin be removed, if conſcience be not troubled under it? The more the Sinners conſcience is at peace, the more ſin is in power, <hi>The ſtrong man armed keeps that houſe,</hi> Luke 11.12. Beſides, it is the deſign of God that ſin ſhall be the trouble of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Sinners conſcience ſooner or later, here or in Hell. Hell is full of troubled conſciences, there is not one ſoul there but lyes under ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of conſcience for ſin; for that is <hi>the worm that never dies,</hi> Mark 9.44. And is it not a mercy to be troubled for ſin here rather than in Hell? Here the trouble is but for a ſeaſon, there it will be for ever. Here the end of your trouble for ſin is peace and comfort. <hi>Weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning,</hi> Pſal. 30.5. But in Hell your trouble will end in deſperation and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing horrour. Whatever therefore your
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:63179:41"/>
troubles are, yet reckon it for a mercy that God hath brought you to a real ſenſe of your ſin and miſery, for that this is the only way to drive you out of your ſelves to Chriſt. You had been undone but for this undoing.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Do not be <hi>weary</hi> of the Spirits o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration in his carrying on the work of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction; leſt by growing <hi>weary of his work,</hi> you make him <hi>weary of working.</hi> There are two things Sinners expreſs a great wearineſs under, <hi>viz. the Word, and the Rod.</hi> To ſit long under the <hi>Word,</hi> or to lye long under the <hi>Rod,</hi> O what a wearineſs is it! Now to be weary of theſe is to be weary of the Spirits work; for by theſe he calls and knocks and ſtrives to make his voice to be heard: and therefore they often go together, and hence you read of <hi>chaſtiſing</hi> and <hi>teaching,</hi> Pſal. 94.12. The <hi>Rod</hi> prepares us for hearkening to the <hi>Word,</hi> and the <hi>Word</hi> teaches us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Rod; and therefore the Spirit ſometimes uſes them together. He <hi>binds them in Fetters, and holds them in Cords of affliction, and then ſhews their work and their tranſgreſſions, that they have exceeded,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 36.8.9, 10.</note> and ſo <hi>opens their ear to diſcipline, and commands that they return from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity.</hi> Why then ſhould any be weary of the Spirits work? And yet that it is ſo, is moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident. For why do Sinners ſo many ways ſtifle the motions of the Spirit in the ſoul? ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times looking on ſpiritual troubles as mere melancholy ſancies, and as ſuch ſhake them off? Sometimes they are ſtifled by ſhame, leſt others ſhould think them mad and diſtracted.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:63179:42"/>
Sometimes they are ſtifled by declining that Miniſtry that deals moſt with the conſcience, and will not let them alone in ſin. Sometimes by running into idle debauched company, that ſcoff away the troubles of a convinced conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Sometimes by over buſineſs in worldly matters, <hi>The cares of this World choke the Seed, and it becomes unfruitful,</hi> Matth. 13.22.</p>
               <p>And is not this a great ſin? (it is murder to deſtroy a Child in the womb.) I charge you young ones with this ſin this day before the Lord. And I will prove you guilty of it: For what is the reaſon that the Word preached hath ſo little ſucceſs, that ſo few of you are converted from your ſins and luſts to Chriſt? I tell you this is the reaſon, You have ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled the motions of the Spirit of God in your ſouls, you have reſiſted and quenched him, you have broken his <hi>Yoke</hi> from off your neck; and do ye underſtand what ye do? Do ye know the miſchief of this ſin?</p>
               <p>It drives the Holy Spirit out of the heart. You ſay to him <hi>depart,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 21.14.</note> you are weary of his ſtriving to make you weary of ſinning.</p>
               <p>It greatly gratifies Satan. For his deſign is to harden the heart againſt the impreſſions of the Spirit, and ſo lead Sinners to a Hell through a Fools Paradiſe.</p>
               <p>It provokes the Lord to give you up to your own hearts luſts and vile affections.<note place="margin">Rom. 2.24, 26.</note> And I am perſwaded that it is the Judgment that many of the young Generation of this day lye under.</p>
               <p>It provokes him to take away the Goſpel.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:63179:42"/>
And I am afraid that this Judgment is at the door; for why ſhould God continue it to a Generation that ſlight and reject it? And wo to ſuch as ſhall be found to have had a hand in ſinning away the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>It is this ſin that makes Hell hot indeed. It will be one of the ſaddeſt reflections in that ſtate for a damned Sinner to recal the many ſweet motions of the Spirit, which in his day of Grace he had. In ſuch a Sermon how was my heart touched, and my conſcience awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened! But all came to nothing. In ſuch a ſickneſs, how did the Spirit of God deal with me, and ſet ſin home, and made it a burthen! What promiſes and reſolutions did I then make to ſhake off ſins, to leave my former wicked courſes, but it came to nothing! Had I then yielded to the ſtrivings of the Spirit, and hearkened to his calls and counſels, I had never felt theſe flames. But my ſlighting God, breaking the Spirits <hi>Yoke</hi> by reſiſting and quenching his motions, this is that which hath brought this endleſs miſery upon me. O what a dreadful thing is it to be weary of the Spirits work, when he comes to convince of ſin?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But when may a man be ſaid to be weary of the Spirits work?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, When he cannot endure an awakening, convincing Miniſtry, nor ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truths; but declines thoſe Doctrines that interrupt him in the way of his luſts, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the quiet of his conſcience; as <hi>Felix</hi> did <hi>Paul</hi>'s Sermon <hi>of righteouſneſs and judgment to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:63179:43"/>
come,</hi> becauſe it made him tremble; the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine came too cloſe to his conſcience, and therefore he diſmiſſes the Preacher to a fitter ſeaſon, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.25.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When he is over-haſty for peace and comfort, then he is weary of the Spirits <hi>Yoke.</hi> This is the Caſe of moſt, they are no ſooner under the ſenſe of ſin, but they muſt have comfort. The <hi>Arrows of the Almighty</hi> are ſharp, and when they go deep do cauſe an unſpeakable ſmart, no wounds to the wounds of God in the conſcience, <hi>A wounded Spirit who can bear?</hi> Prov. 18.14. In this Caſe it is very natural to cry out for comfort. But to ſeek the cure for a wound before it is ſearched and cleanſed, is to make the remedy worſe than the diſeaſe. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſeaſonable</hi> comfort is ever <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound</hi> comfort. And when it comes before the Sinner is fit for it, it is then <hi>unſeaſonable;</hi> and ſuch comfort is from Satan, not from the Comforter; for he firſt makes the ſoul fit to receive comfort, and then applies it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> When is the ſoul prepared and fit to receive comfort?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Five things muſt concur to make up this meetneſs for comfort:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The heart muſt be truly broken and humbled under a ſenſe of ſin. Comfort is proper for Mourners, and therefore the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is made to ſuch, <hi>I will reſtore comfort to his Mourners,</hi> Iſai. 57.18. <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourn, for they ſhall be comforted.</hi> Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on fits for conſolation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> When wearineſs of the burthen
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:63179:43"/>
of ſin drives the Sinner to Chriſt. Many run to Chriſt under their convictions, that yet are not fit for comfort; for it is <hi>ſmart</hi> that drives them, and not <hi>guilt; ſorrow,</hi> and not <hi>ſin;</hi> and therefore they ſeek more for <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>eaſe</hi> than for <hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs.</hi> Though ſuch may deſire comfort, yet they are not fit for it,<note place="margin">Matth. 11.28.</note> for reſt is for the <hi>weary and heavy laden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When it is made freely willing not only to come to Chriſt, but to cloſe with and receive him upon his own terms; that is, as a <hi>Prince</hi> to <hi>rule,</hi> as well as a <hi>Prieſt</hi> to redeem and <hi>ſave;</hi> when it is as willing to ſubmit to the Duties of his <hi>Yoke,</hi> as to reap the benefits of his <hi>Croſs;</hi> as deſirous to be <hi>ſanctified</hi> as <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;</hi> to be freed from ſins <hi>reigning power,</hi> as well as from its <hi>damning guilt.</hi> Then is it fit for comfort.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> When the Work of converſion is actually wrought in the ſoul, then it is fit for comfort. A ſtate of ſin cannot be a ſtate of comfort, <hi>There is no peace, ſaith my God, to the wicked,</hi> Iſai. 57.21. The Spirit of God cannot be a <hi>comforting</hi> Spirit where he is not a <hi>converting</hi> Spirit. Could he be ſuppoſed to work peace without Grace, he would <hi>harden</hi> the Sinner in ſin, inſtead of <hi>turning</hi> him from it; and ſo contradict his own deſign, which is firſt to work <hi>Grace,</hi> and then <hi>peace;</hi> firſt, he <hi>converts,</hi> and then he <hi>comforts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> When a man makes conſcience of Duties, and uſes all means for the obtaining comfort, as if it were to be obtained by doing,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:63179:44"/>
and yet at the ſame time depends upon the Spirit for comfort, as if he had done nothing. Some look to their Duties for comfort, and ſo ſlight the Spirit, whoſe work is to give comfort; and others look that the Spirit ſhould do all, and ſo ſinfully neglect thoſe means by which comfort comes in. Means without the Spirit cannot comfort, and the Spirit in the neglect of means will not; but when a man depends upon the Spirit in the uſe of means, then he is fit for comfort.</p>
               <p>But if the heart be not broken, if ſin be not a burthen, if the will be not bowed to Chriſt by converting Grace, it is not prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red nor fit for comfort; the ſeaſon of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is not yet. And therefore to deſire it without labouring for a meetneſs for it, is to be weary of the Spirits <hi>Yoke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Then a man is weary of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits <hi>Yoke,</hi> when he uſes improper remedies, skins over the wounds the Spirit makes in the ſoul with wrong Plaiſters; turning from a looſe converſation to a profeſſion of Religion, and ſo by an empty form of godlineſs bringing in a deluſive peace, to the undoing of his ſoul. Know this, That nothing can adminiſter true quiet to a wounded conſcience, but the bloud of Jeſus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. It is the cunning of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to hurry a troubled Sinner to an empty profeſſion of Religion, that ſo he may take upſhort of Chriſt and converſion. He is for any work, but a ſaving work. Take heed therefore of uſing improper remedies for the cure of ſoul-wounds; and (which is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:63179:44"/>
caution in this place) take heed of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent Guides, and unskilful Conductors of thy ſoul in this Caſe. There needs <hi>one of a thouſand</hi> to be an <hi>Interpreter</hi> in this matter.<note place="margin">Job 33.23.</note> All that take upon them to be Preachers, are not fit for this work; they do not skill how to deal with a wounded conſcience; ſome make the wound too wide, ſome bind it up too ſoon, ſome uſe improper remedies for healing.</p>
               <p>There are many <hi>ſpiritual Mountebanks</hi> as well as <hi>natural,</hi> that poyſon ſick ſouls, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do ſick Patients. Of all things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take heed what <hi>ſpiritual Phyſicians</hi> you go to when you are under a wounded conſcience, and ſick of ſin: for he that ſhall <hi>bind</hi> where God <hi>looſeth,</hi> or <hi>looſe</hi> where God <hi>binds,</hi> is <hi>unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the word of righteouſneſs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 5.13.</note> and knows not how or when to apply either the terrours of the Law, or the comforts of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Then a man is weary of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits work, when he breaks off his <hi>Yoke.</hi> Such were they in <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.5. <hi>They have altogether broke the Yoke, and burſt the bonds.</hi> This is done by ſtifling the Spirits motions, refuſing his counſels, blotting out the impreſſions he makes. Indeed a ſtate of conviction is not a ſtate to continue in; therefore we ought to labour in the uſe of God's appointed means to get out of it. Though it is a mercy to be brought under the Spirits bonds and bondage, yet the mercy is not with reference to the ſtate it ſelf, but to what follows; therefore it is good to paſs through it, but not to continue in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:63179:45"/>Convictions are like travailing pangs, which are a mercy, as being greatly helpful to the forwarding the birth; but if they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ever long, they ſpend natural ſtrength, and deſtroy the Mother and the Infant too. Hence that of God to <hi>Ephraim, Hoſ.</hi> 13.13. <hi>The ſorrows of a travailing woman ſhall come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, he is an unwiſe Son, for he ſhould not ſtay long in the place of breaking forth of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> To ſtay long in the birth deſtroys both the birth and the Bearer too. <hi>The captive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile haſteneth that he may be looſed, and that he ſhould not dye in the pit,</hi> Iſai. 51.14. But yet take heed of making more haſte than good ſpeed. Though it is a Duty to labour to get from under the <hi>ſtate of bondage,</hi> yet it is a ſin to break the <hi>Yoke of the Spirit of bondage;</hi> therefore take heed of this. The preſent Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is to wait the Spirits ſeaſon,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 3.1.</note> 
                  <hi>To every thing there is a ſeaſon; there is a time to kill, and a time to heal;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ver. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>a time to break down, and a time to build up:</hi> this is the Spirits ſeaſon. And then it follows,<note place="margin">ver. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>There is a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance:</hi> that is your ſeaſon. His <hi>killing</hi> and <hi>breaking</hi> time, is your <hi>weeping</hi> and <hi>mourning</hi> time; but when his <hi>healing</hi> time comes, then is your time to <hi>laugh</hi> and <hi>dance.</hi> Be willing therefore to be <hi>ſlain</hi> by the <hi>coming of the Commandment,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7.9.</note> and to lye dead under the Spirits wounds, till the healing and reviving time comes. Is there not a promiſe that <hi>the Sun of righteouſneſs ſhall ariſe with healing in his wings?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mal. 4.2.</note> and that <hi>he that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious ſeed,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:63179:45"/>
ſhall doubtleſs come again with rejoycing,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 126.6.</note> 
                  <hi>bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſheavs with him?</hi> And therefore do not dare to uſe any indirect means in hopes of relief; he that would ſee a good iſſue of this work muſt ſtay the time;<note place="margin">Lam. 3.26.</note> 
                  <hi>It is good that a man ſhould both hope and quietly wait for the ſalvation of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. While you are under the <hi>Yoke</hi> of the Spirit, give diligence to make a right uſe of it, by improving your convictions while you are under them, leſt the Spirit ceaſe his work and leave you, and ſo your convictions die, and wither, and come to nothing. This is a very common caſe; for whence is it that convictions do ſo ſeldom end in converſion? Many are convinced, and yet few converted: they have many and ſtrong convictions, yet periſh under them: they are made to ſee their loſt eſtate, and yet never come to Jeſus Chriſt. Now whence is this, but from the ſlighting and not improving their convictions? Of all duties therefore be ſure make Conſcience of this, when the Spirit ſtrives, then do you ſtrive, when he works, then is your time to work. I pray conſider four things.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Prov. 17.16.</note> What <hi>a price to get wiſdom</hi> this work of the Spirit puts into our hands: and ſhall it be <hi>a price in the hand of fools, that have no heart to it?</hi> no deſire to obtain it? The ſtrivings of the Spirit time your ſeaſons of grace: For though every day is a time to repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in; yet a man hath not his ſpecial ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and opportunities for this every day. Opportunity is more than time, it is the nick
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:63179:46"/>
and ſeaſon of time, it is time fitted for acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a conjunction of time and means toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bring a thing about. When God ſhews a man his undone condition by reaſon of ſin, and makes a tender of Chriſt to him, and the Spirit ſtrives with him to bring him to accept the tender, then is his ſeaſon. As the Lord ſaid to <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 5.24. <hi>When thou heareſt the ſound of a going in the tops of the mulberry-trees, then thou ſhalt beſtir thy ſelf, for then ſhall the Lord go out before thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider how eaſie the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is of thoſe ſinners that comply with and duly improve the ſeaſons of the Spirit. All things are eaſie in the Spirits ſeaſons. Great births are brought forth with eaſie travail. How came <hi>Sarah,</hi> barren <hi>Sarah,</hi> to have a Son at ninety years old?<note place="margin">Gen. 18.10.</note> why God came <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the time of life,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> is born. So when the Spirit comes according to the time of life, when his ſeaſon is to bring life to a dead Soul, then it lives; you muſt know that <hi>Iſaac</hi> was not ſo much the Son of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> loyns as of Gods promiſe, begotten by the Power of God making good the promiſe; and therefore called <hi>a child of promiſe,</hi> Gal, 4.28. So is every Believer; <hi>born, not of the will of the fleſh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 1.13.</note> 
                  <hi>but of God.</hi> By the power of God put forth through the promiſe. And hence all things in converſion become eaſie. How difficult ſoever they are to the Creature, yet in the Spirits ſeaſon they are eaſie, becauſe of a Divine power.</p>
               <p>How hard a work is it to repent and turn
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:63179:46"/>
from ſin! a very difficult duty; therefore compared to cutting off a limb: But yet in the Spirits ſeaſon how eaſie is it. <hi>Zacheus,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>make haſte, and come down:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 19.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> here is the ſeaſon of Chriſt upon his Soul; and how eaſily is his repentance brought about.<note place="margin">verſ. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor, and if I have taken ought fiom any man by falſe accuſation, I reſtore him fourfold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How hard a work is the work of believing! no duty more difficult. It is eaſier to keep all the commands of the Law, than that one command of believing: And yet when the ſeaſon of the Spirit comes, how eaſie is it. For now all things concur to bring it about, the Commandment comes, the eyes are open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſin is made burdenſom, the need of Chriſt is felt, and by theſe means the Spirit <hi>draws,</hi> and then the ſinner <hi>runs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ah how eaſie are all things in converſion made by the Spirits ſeaſons to the Soul that complies with them and improves them!</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Conſider this is the higheſt and laſt of means for converſion. (1) It is the higheſt, it is that which puts efficacy into all other means, which without it can operate nothing. It is that which can make the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt means as ſucceſsful againſt the proudeſt luſts, as the Rams horns were againſt <hi>Jericho,</hi> though her walls reached to Heaven. (2) It is the laſt means that God ever uſes to convert ſinners, he hath appointed no other means to ſucceed this; and therefore if you ſin againſt your convictions you quench the Spirit, and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:63179:47"/>
he may be ſo quenched as never to be kindled again, and then your converſion becomes a thing impoſſible. And therefore</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Conſider what a miſchief it brings upon you not to improve the convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Is it not a miſchief when all the Ordinances and means of Grace are rendred fruitleſs and unſucceſsful? This is an effect of not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Spirits convictions.</p>
               <p>Nay, is it not a miſchief to turn the edge of that Word againſt your Souls, that was deſigned againſt your ſins? This is a fruit of not improving the Spirits convictions.</p>
               <p>Is it not a miſchief when the heart grows harder and harder under ſoftning means? This is a fruit of not improving the Spirits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions.</p>
               <p>Is it not a miſchief to be delivered up to a <hi>cannot</hi> in believing? Why he that improves not the convictions of the Spirit, provokes him finally to depart, and then the ſinner is delivered up to a <hi>cannot</hi> in believing. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could not believe,</hi> Joh. 12.39.</p>
               <p>Is it not a miſchief when the Oath of God ſeals up a perſons, or a peoples deſtruction? Why thus it is when the convictions of the Spirit are not improved. <hi>I ſware in my wrath that they ſhould not enter into my reſt,</hi> Pſal. 95.11. And who were theſe? They were a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that had long reſiſted the ſtrivings of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>O therefore be diligent to improve your convictions while you are under them. And
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:63179:47"/>
if you ask me how they muſt be improved? I ſhall give only this one anſwer: and that is</p>
               <p>By haſtening to Jeſus Chriſt for pardoning and converting Grace. You never improve your convictions aright till you are brought by them to a ſaving cloſe with Jeſus Chriſt. In conviction of ſin the Soul is purſued with the <hi>avenger of blood,</hi> and if he overtakes him, he ſlays him: there is no eſcaping but by <hi>flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to the <hi>City of refuge.</hi> So Chriſt is called, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18. the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> there uſed, doth import two things; (1) <hi>An apprehenſion and ſenſe of impendent danger</hi> putting a man upon flight for deliverance, leſt the evil fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhould overtake him. (2) <hi>Speed and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi> in that flight to the place where he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects to find ſuccour and ſafety. And where is the place of ſafety for a ſinner under guilt, and purſued by the Curſe of the Law, and dread of the wrath of God, but only in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? Hence is that counſel of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Turn ye to the ſtrong hold ye priſoners of hope,</hi> Zech. 9.12. O make haſte to Jeſus Chriſt, ſo did <hi>Zacheus</hi> when Chriſt called him, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.5. <hi>He made haſte, and came down and received him joyfully,</hi> v. 6.</p>
               <p>You that are young, and have had <hi>early</hi> ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings of the Spirit, <hi>early</hi> convictions of ſin, ſee that ye improve them by an early ſeeking after Jeſus Chriſt, otherwiſe the Spirit may ceaſe ſtriving, and depart and never return again; thy convictions may die and never revive again; thy day of Grace may be ſinned away, and then it can never be recalled again.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:63179:48"/>
Other things a man may loſe, and recover them again. He may loſe his health, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it again; he may loſe his eſtate, and recover it again; but if thy day of Grace be once loſt, thou canſt never recover that again, no, not for any price, thou canſt not pray it back again, nor weep it back again. <hi>Eſau</hi>'s tears come too late, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.17. no ſorrow, no repentance will recover it; and therefore bleſſed are they that have improved the <hi>Yoke</hi> of the Spirit into a ſaving union with Jeſus Chriſt, that by being made to feel the burden of ſin, and the weight of Gods wrath, and ſo ſeeing their loſt and undone ſtate as in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, have been outed of themſelves, and made willing to accept of Chriſt upon Gods conditions, and in Gods ſeaſon, and ſo have believed in him to the ſaving of their Souls.</p>

               <p n="1">1. That Jeſus Chriſt hath his <hi>Yoke.</hi> For he is a <hi>King,</hi> as well as a <hi>Prieſt</hi> and a <hi>Prophet.</hi> As he redeemed us by his Blood, ſo he rules us by his Power. As he is a <hi>Prieſt upon his Throne,</hi>

               <p n="2">2. Why is it called a <hi>Yoke?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. What is this <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It conſiſts of his Commands, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe Conditions which the Lord Chriſt puts upon every ſoul in order to the obtaining of that Salvation and Glory which he hath purchaſed. For Chriſt hath not ſo purchaſed Salvation for any, as that they ſhould be ſaved meerly upon the account of his Death. There were certain Terms and Conditions of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion agreed upon between the Father and the Son in that Covenant of Redemption that paſſed between them, and none can be ſaved
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:63179:49"/>
by all which Chriſt hath done and ſuffered, but upon theſe Conditions, and they are, <hi>Self-denial, Faith, Repentance, taking up the Croſs, Obedience,</hi> all the neceſſary duties of Religion. Theſe are the unalterable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Life and Salvation; and theſe Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Salvation are the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt. <hi>Take my yoke upon you,</hi> Mat. 11.29. And this <hi>Yoke</hi> is variouſly expreſſed in Scripture, ſometimes it is called a <hi>Way: The way of the Lord,</hi> Prov. 10.29. <hi>The way of righteouſneſs,</hi> Prov. 8.20. <hi>The way of holineſs,</hi> Iſai. 35.8. <hi>The good old way,</hi> Jer. 6.16. <hi>The way everlaſting,</hi> Pſal. 139.24. Sometimes it is called a <hi>Burden, Mat.</hi> 11.30. <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.24. Sometimes it is called a <hi>Rule, Gal.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.16.</p>
               <p>But moſt commonly this <hi>Yoke</hi> is called a <hi>Law,</hi> and ſo points to the Soveraignty of God over man in common with the reſt of the Creatures. For all Creatures that ever God made are under a Law. The moſt glorious part of the Creation of God was the humane Nature of Chriſt, and yet that was made in a ſtate of ſubjection to a Law; <hi>Made under the Law, Gal.</hi> 4.4.

               <p>Look into the lower Heaven, and you ſhall find a governing Law there: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148.8. <hi>Fire and hail, ſnow and vapor, ſtormy wind fulfilling his word.</hi> Who can govern the <hi>wind</hi> that <hi>blows where it liſts?</hi>

               <p>Look lower to that raging and unruly Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Sea; no Potentate on Earth can bridle one wave. <hi>Xerxes</hi> preſumed he could tame the <hi>Hellespont,</hi> but it knew not his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, nor felt his wrath; neither could his three hundred ſtripes allay the fury of its waves, nor his fetters, thrown in, bind it from ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:63179:50"/>It is ſtoried of <hi>Canutus</hi> our Daniſh King, that when his Courtiers would have flattered him into a belief of a kind of Omnipotency in him, he cauſed his Chair to be ſet by the Sea-ſhore at time of flood, and ſitting down commands the Sea thus, <hi>I charge thee come not upon my Land, nor wet my Robes.</hi> But the Sea coming on, without regard to his Command, made him glad to retreat, whereupon he crys out, <hi>How vain and weak is the power of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>None but God can <hi>ſet bars and doors</hi> to it, as it is <hi>Job</hi> 38.10. And what are theſe bars and doors? not the ſands, nor banks, nor rocks, ſo much as the Law of Heaven; for ſo it follows in the next words, <hi>Hitherto ſhalt thou come, but no further, and here ſhall thy proud waves be ſtaid,</hi> v. 11. This is the bound it can't paſs over, other banks and bounds it can, and hath paſſed, as in <hi>Noahs</hi> Deluge, Hiſtory reports of many ſad inundations of the Sea, no bound can hold it but this Law of Heaven: <hi>Thou hast ſet a bound that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters may not paſs over, that they turn not again to cover the earth,</hi> Pſal. 104.9.</p>
               <p>So that all Creatures are under a Law ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which all their motions are guided and governed.

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:63179:51"/>
of Gods revealed will to all that are under the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>And the will of God is revealed two ways, in his <hi>Word,</hi> and in his <hi>Works.</hi> The one is <hi>voluntas de nobis,</hi> Gods will concerning us: The other is <hi>voluntas in nobis,</hi> his will in us, to be done by us; in the one conſiſts our <hi>active</hi> obedience, in the other our <hi>paſſive; active</hi> obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience reſpects his <hi>Precepts, paſſive</hi> reſpects his <hi>Providences;</hi> and obedience is as truly manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in the one, as in the other; in <hi>patience</hi> as in <hi>Holineſs;</hi> for as in <hi>Holineſs</hi> we owne God as the ſupreme <hi>Law-giver,</hi> ſo in <hi>patience</hi> we owne him as the ſupreme <hi>Lord,</hi> who hath abſolute Dominion over all Creatures and all Events. And this is the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And it hath ſix eſſential Properties belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, which do ſo deſcribe the Nature of it, as that it may be diſtinguiſhed from all other <hi>Yokes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> It is a <hi>pure Yoke:</hi> and needs it muſt; for it is a <hi>Yoke</hi> put on us by that Law which is a Tranſcript of the Holineſs of God. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> calls it, <hi>pure Religion,</hi> Jam. 1.27. And it is ſo, whether you look to its Precepts or its Promiſes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, To its Precepts, <hi>The commandment of the Lord is pure,</hi> Pſal. 19.8. <hi>Holy, juſt, and good,</hi> Rom. 7.12. No Doctrine ſo holy, no Precepts ſo pure.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To its Promiſes: They are pure Promiſes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In regard of the matter of them: they do not flatter us with ſenſual delights and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:63179:51"/>
brutiſh pleaſures,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.4.</note> but ſecure to us an <hi>undefiled inheritance;</hi> not a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Paradiſe full of ſwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſenſualities, but a ſinleſs felicity made up of viſions of God and likeneſs to him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In regard of the end and deſign of them, which is to purifie the heart, and promote the ſanctification of the whole man. <hi>He hath given us exceeding great and precious promiſes, that by theſe you might be partakers of the divine nature,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.4. No Religion in the World can rightfully lay a claim to this Character of a <hi>pure Religion,</hi> but the Chriſtian Reformed Religion.</p>
               <p>Compare it with the Religion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the moſt like to be a perfect Religion of any, becauſe it was a Religion of Gods ſetting up; but yet that had its imperfections, their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, wherein it chiefly conſiſted,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.1.</note> 
                  <hi>could not make the comers thereto perfect;</hi> and therefore it is done away.</p>
               <p>Compare it with the Religion of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens:</hi> And how corrupt hath that been in all ages and in all parts? What a numberleſs number of Gods have been found among them<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Varro</hi> rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons up more than 30000.</note>? Some worſhipping dead men for Gods<note n="b" place="margin">As <hi>Belus</hi> (or <hi>Bel,</hi> or <hi>Baal</hi>) whoſe image was ſet up after his death, by his Son <hi>Ninus,</hi> who was the firſt Idolater, <hi>Diodor. Plutarch</hi> ſays the <hi>Egyptian</hi> God <hi>Oſyris,</hi> was a man; ſuch was <hi>Saturn,</hi> made a God by his Grandſon <hi>Faunus:</hi> ſuch was <hi>Mercury, Vulcan, Apollo, Mars,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Cicero,</hi> in his Book <hi>De Natura Deorum,</hi> ſhews that all their Gods were but men.</note>. Some worſhipping dumb Creatures<note n="c" place="margin">As the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> &amp;c.</note>. Some worſhipping Sun, Moon, and Stars<note n="d" place="margin">As the <hi>Arabians,</hi> &amp;c.</note>. Some worſhipping Herbs and Plants. And
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:63179:52"/>
ſome worſhipping Devils, it is a filthy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion making Gods of them who made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Devils<note n="e" place="margin">As the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans,</hi> and the old <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Grecians</hi> under the name of <hi>Pluto, Proſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina, Cerberus,</hi> &amp;c.</note>.</p>
               <p>Compare it with the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Religion, and what is that, but a mixture of Jewiſh, Heatheniſh, and Popiſh vanities, little of truth to be found in it. A Religion not known in the World till 600 years after Chriſt<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mahomet</hi> was born under <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritius</hi> the Emperor, <hi>An. Chriſti</hi> 591.</note>. A Religion deviſed by <hi>Mahomet</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">With the aſſiſtance of <hi>Sergius,</hi> a <hi>Neſtorian</hi> Monk, and ſome other Jews and Hereticks.</note> that Impoſtor, and made up for the moſt part of fooliſh Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and as ridiculous rewards<note n="c" place="margin">To the obſervers of his Laws he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes a Paradiſe furniſhed with pleaſant rivers, fruitful trees, ſilken carpets, beautiful women, choice muſick, good chear, rich wines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note>, deſigned chiefly to gratifie the fleſh.</p>
               <p>Compare it with the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Religion, and how much more pure is it than that both in Doctrine, Worſhip, and Diſcipline?</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Doctrine</hi> is impure: It is in many things contrary to the Scriptures, as about <hi>Venial ſins, Merits of Works, Supererogation, forbidding to Marry, their ſeven Sacraments, Purgatory,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And in ſome things it is contrary to reaſon and ſenſe, as in that ridiculous Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their <hi>Worſhip</hi> is impure, witneſs their <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to Saints and Angels; their Image-worſhip, their making their publick Prayers in a Language
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:63179:52"/>
the people understand not; their Maſſes, their denying the Cup in the Lords Supper to the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their <hi>Diſcipline</hi> is impure; for whereas the Church is to be governed by Chriſt his Laws only, they have contrived a Diſcipline of their own, and make their Canons and Conſtitutions to take place of the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Jeſus Chriſt; thus the <hi>man of ſin ſits as God in the temple of God,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 4.4. O what a corrupt, filthy Religion is that of <hi>Rome!</hi> an intolerable <hi>Yoke,</hi> and therefore our Forefathers did righteouſly caſt it off, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver let us their children any more put it on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt is a <hi>spiritual Yoke,</hi> it reacheth the ſoul as well as the ſenſes. There is an <hi>intra</hi> as well as an <hi>extra,</hi> an <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> power binding the heart, as well as an <hi>external</hi> that aweth the outward man. The Laws of men have no ſpiritual power, they govern the outward man, but can't reach to the heart and conſcience. A man may love ſin, meditate miſchief, think treaſon, and yet liable to no humane Law without overt-acts: But Chriſt's Law reaches the inwards, <hi>it is the diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</hi> It binds the ſoul to its behaviour,<note place="margin">Heb. 4.12.</note> as well as the ſenſes: ſo that a man may be a tranſgreſſor of the Law, though he refrains all open wickedneſs. For <hi>the Law is ſpiritual,</hi> Rom. 7.14. and therefore requires not only <hi>outward</hi> obedience in <hi>word</hi> and <hi>deed,</hi> but <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> in <hi>mind</hi> and <hi>heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is a <hi>ſtrict</hi> and <hi>abſolute Yoke,</hi> it lays the ſoul under an abſolute ſubjection, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:63179:53"/>
of nothing to be done but what is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of God; what God doth either command or warrant; nor doth it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate ought of what God would have perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Though the <hi>Grace</hi> of the Goſpel paſſes by many ſins,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.16.</note> 
                  <hi>the free gift is of many offences to juſtification,</hi> yet the <hi>Precepts</hi> of the Goſpel al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of no ſin: Though the young Man kept many commands, yet becauſe he failed in one thing <hi>(one thing thou lackeſt)</hi> all was nothing.<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>k 10.21.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Covenant of Works did not require a more ſtrict obedience, when it was for life, than the Law of Chriſt doth. It leaves the Creature no liberty for the leaſt ſin. It is a <hi>yoke</hi> of abſolute ſubjection without conditions or reſerves; and when we give up our ſelves to the government of the Divine will, it is to a ſubjection that is abſolute; we are to <hi>have no other God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 20.3.</note> he is to be <hi>Lord alone.</hi> If you have a ſervant, and bid him do this or that, it may be he will tell you, it is not my work, it was none of my bargain; I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſerve in the Chamber, but not in the Kitchin; or to be your Steward, but not to ſerve in the Stable. But the <hi>yoke</hi> of Chriſt admits of none of theſe conditions, for the Law is indiviſible. You may number the commands, but you may not divide them, for they are but the various ſignifications of the ſame Divine will. The Precepts of the Goſpel are not to be taken <hi>disjunctim,</hi> but <hi>completive,</hi> not ſingly, but all together; and ſo they make one intire Law of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: And therefore he that wilfully ſlights
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:63179:53"/>
any one command of Chriſt, breaks the <hi>yoke;</hi> he violates <hi>totam legem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jam. 2.1.</note> though not <hi>totum le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis,</hi> the whole Law, though not every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. As he that breaks one link, breaks the whole chain. Or as he that breaks a mans arm, wrongs the whole man, though he doth not break every limb.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is an <hi>extenſive Yoke.</hi> It com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the whole of mans obedience. It preſcribes every duty; we have no need to run to humane inventions to direct our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; both the <hi>credenda</hi> and the <hi>agenda,</hi> whatever is to be believed and done in order to life eternal, is preſcribed in the Word. <hi>Thy commandment is exceeding broad,</hi> Pſal. 119.96. Will you ſee in a few things where the latitude of it lies?</p>
               <p>Firſt, It reaches from Heaven to Earth. It directs our carriage and behaviour to God and man, and teaches us to keep a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence void of offence towards both. <hi>The grace of God that brings ſalvation— teaches us to live righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tit. 2.11, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> to God is not enough without <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to man, nor <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> to man without <hi>holineſs</hi> to God; that obedience doth not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the end of the command that is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to both; ſome will make conſcience of the <hi>firſt Table</hi> and not of the <hi>ſecond,</hi> and ſome are <hi>ſecond Table</hi> Chriſtians but not <hi>first.</hi> Some are <hi>ſtrict</hi> in their <hi>devotions,</hi> but very <hi>unrighteous</hi> in their <hi>dealings.</hi> They will not bow to an Idol, nor allow of the inventions of men in the worſhip of God, but yet make
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:63179:54"/>
no conſcience of breaking the commands of God that are given to govern their dealings with men; they will not neglect an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, nor ſwear an Oath, but yet will lie and deceive, be uncharitable and cruel, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that command of God to <hi>deal juſtly and love mercy.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mic. 6.8.</note> As if that Law of <hi>loving thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thy ſelf,</hi> were abrogated, to let in a liberty for ſelf to compaſs its own ends upon all, without regard to any.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, ſome are very juſt and equal in their dealings with men, but very neglectful and regardleſs of God; they will not bow down to a <hi>Harlot,</hi> but yet will bow down to an <hi>Idol.</hi> They will not defile their bodies with fornication and uncleanneſs, and yet, in love to an unclean worſhip, drink daily <hi>of the wine of Babylons fornication;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 17.2.</note> they will not wrong their neighbour of a farthing, and yet ſtick not to rob God of all that truſt, love,<note place="margin">Iſai. 30.10.</note> fear and worſhip that is due to him; they will not lye nor deceive among men, and yet love a lying and deceitful Religion. This is the faſhion of the world, to be in with one duty, and out with another. Some labour to keep conſcience void of offence to man, but not to God; and ſome labour to keep con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience void of offence to God, but not to man; but <hi>the yoke of Chriſt extends to both,</hi> it lies equally on both ſhoulders, and teaches how <hi>to keep a conſcience void of offence both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and man.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 24.16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, This <hi>Yoke</hi> is <hi>extenſive</hi> in regard of the ſubject. It reaches to every man, and to every thing in man.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:63179:54"/>Firſt, To every man; <hi>to every age of man,</hi> young and old, children and fathers, tender years and gray hairs, it doth not only lay du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon young ſhoulders,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Remember thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in the days of thy youth,</hi> but upon old ones too, <hi>They ſhall bring forth fruit in old age.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>To every Eſtate;</hi> this <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt reaches duty to them that are out of the <hi>Yoke,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Yoke;</hi> to the unmarried and to them who are married. As the unmarried are to <hi>care for the things of the Lord,</hi>

And therefore it is charged as a great ſin upon him who, when he was invited to the Wedding-ſupper, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed the Call of Chriſt upon that pretence, <hi>I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come,</hi> Luke 14.20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To every degree and rank of men;</hi> high and low, rich and poor, great and ſmall,<note place="margin">Pſal. 148.11.</note> 
                  <hi>Kings of the earth and all people.</hi> The Law of Chriſt lays the ſame <hi>Yoke</hi> upon all.

                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It reaches to commands for <hi>ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> as well as commands for <hi>doing.</hi> For you muſt know that the <hi>Croſs</hi> of Chriſt is a part of the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt. <hi>If any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his croſs, and follow me,</hi> Matt. 16.24.

Then we bear the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt becomingly, when the excellency of the <hi>Pearl of price</hi> makes us willing to <hi>ſell all</hi> to <hi>make the purchaſe;</hi> when we prefer Chriſt and his Croſs before all worldly injoyments, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, <hi>eſteeming the reproaches of Chriſt greater riches than the treaſures of Egypt,</hi> Heb. 11.26.</p>

               <p>Four things muſt concur to make an action truly good, and an act of obedience. The <hi>Principle,</hi> the <hi>Rule,</hi> the <hi>Manner,</hi> and the <hi>End.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p>Some ſet up <hi>their lusts</hi> for a rule; as moſt men ſet up their luſts for a rule of life, ſo ſome men ſet up their luſts for a rule of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.

               <p>
                  <hi>Lust</hi> (take it as an <hi>act,</hi> for ſo I now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it) is nothing elſe, but <hi>a vehement deſire.</hi> And it is either good or evil as the object is, for there is the <hi>lusting</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi>

               <p>Theſe therefore are all falſe rules, and however men may pleaſe themſelves in ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their lives by them, yet they are but ſo many <hi>by-ways</hi> to lead us off from our own happineſs.

And he cannot be upright in the way, who walks by a crooked rule.</p>

Which Command may I break upon the priviledge of intereſt in Chriſt? or refuſe to obey as a part of Goſpel-liberty? And if every Command of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law requires obedience, as it doth, how great is his Duty! But this is not all. For</p>
               <p>Secondly, He owes obedience to the Goſpel too: For this is more peculiarly the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt. And how many Duties go to make up Goſpel-obedience! There muſt be believing in Chriſt, repenting of ſin, denying our ſelves, renouncing the world, crucifying the fleſh with its affections and luſts; cutting off the right hand, plucking out the right eye, cleaving to the truths of Chriſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:63179:60"/>
for the Faith, praying in the Spirit, watching in all things, reſiſting temptations, growing in grace, worſhipping God in the Spirit, abounding in hope, rejoycing in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> O how laborious a work is it to take up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt! Indeed Chriſt ſays it is eaſie, <hi>Matt.</hi> 11.30.<hi>my yoke is eaſie:</hi> but this is in oppoſition <hi>to grievouſneſs,</hi> (1 <hi>John</hi> 5.3.) not to <hi>diligence</hi> and <hi>induſtry.</hi> Chriſt quits us of our <hi>burden,</hi> but not of our <hi>duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt is a <hi>laſting Yoke;</hi> not to be worn at pleaſure and then laid off. <hi>I have given you ſtatutes and judgments,</hi> ſays <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 4.5. <hi>as the Lord commanded me;</hi> and then <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>Take heed leſt they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life.</hi> And <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.21. <hi>My words which I have put in thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed— from henceforth and for ever.</hi> The meaning of this promiſe is, that his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall never want the guidance and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his Word, and therefore they ſhould always follow the guidance of it. <hi>David</hi> begs to be taught the Statutes of God for this very reaſon, that he may <hi>keep them to the end,</hi> Pſal. 119.33. There is no exemption from Duty, no room for intermiſſions in our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Upon thoſe words of <hi>Solomon,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>It is not enough to ſhew our reſpect to the Command at one time and not at another, it muſt reach to all times;<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.20.</note>

Therefore we are never to be <hi>weary of well doing.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 6.9.</note> Why ſhould we? Is not Chriſt as ſweet always at at firſt? The Commands of God as equal? The ways of God as lovely? Heaven as deſirable as ever? However the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt be always the ſame, yet a Chriſtian, in regard of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, hath more reaſon to <hi>keep it on,</hi> than he had at firſt to <hi>take it up;</hi> becauſe <hi>by reaſon of uſe he hath had his ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween good and evil,</hi> Heb. 5.14. He hath had ſuch taſtes of God in the courſe of his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as he was a ſtranger to at the firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance. His experiences are now greater.

Therefore there muſt be no declining; <hi>The

               <p>Thus you have an account what the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt is. It conſiſts of the Commands of Chriſt, which are the Conditions of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. And this <hi>Yoke</hi> is <hi>pure, spiritual, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, extenſive, laborious,</hi> and <hi>laſting.</hi> That is the firſt thing. I will be briefer in the next.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. Why are the Commands of Chriſt called a <hi>Yoke?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. With reſpect to the corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. With reſpect to the nature of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands themſelves.</p>
               <p n="1">1. With reſpect to the corrupt nature of man which accounts them ſo. They are the luſts of the fleſh that make Duty a <hi>Yoke,</hi> or elſe the Precept would be a <hi>Law,</hi> but no <hi>Yoke.</hi> As it is the <hi>ſoreneſs</hi> of the <hi>foot</hi> which makes the ſhooe a <hi>burden,</hi> which otherwiſe would be an <hi>help.</hi> The Angels in Heaven are under a <hi>Law,</hi> but not under a <hi>Yoke;</hi> and ſo are glorified Saints; for in them there is no manner of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitableneſs to, or regret at the will of God.</p>
               <p>Man with reſpect to the Law of God is to be conſidered either as carnal, or converted, unregenerate, or born again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:63179:62"/>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> As <hi>carnal</hi> and <hi>unregenerate;</hi> and while he is in that ſtate, the Law of Chriſt is not only a <hi>Yoke,</hi> but an intolerable <hi>Yoke;</hi> fleſh and blood cannot bear it, becauſe of that enmity that is between the Law of God and his luſts. He is under the prevalency of a quite contrary Law, the Law of Sin; and where the Law of ſin rules, the Law of Chriſt can take no place; <hi>He is not ſubject to the law of God, nor indeed can be,</hi> Rom. 8.7. How can an <hi>evil tree</hi> bring forth <hi>good fruit?</hi> How can darkneſs have communion with light? How can the old nature do the works of the new creature?</p>
               <p>The carnal mind can never bear Chriſts <hi>Yoke,</hi> becauſe of that oppoſition that is in luſt to the Divine Law; it is not only <hi>averſe</hi> to it, but <hi>adverſe;</hi> it doth not only draw the heart from God, but oppoſeth him. Chriſt commands one thing, and the fleſh another; the Command ſays, <hi>Mortifie the fleſh;</hi> Luſt ſays, <hi>Make proviſion for the fleſh;</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is for ſelf-denial, Luſt is for ſelf-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; Chriſt is for obedience and holineſs, and therefore Luſt ſays,<note place="margin">Luke 19.14.</note> 
                  <hi>This man ſhall not rule.</hi> Becauſe the Law oppoſes luſt, therefore luſt oppoſes the Law,<note place="margin">Jer. 23.34.</note> it crys out, <hi>The burden of the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 6.60.</note> it complains of <hi>hard ſayings,</hi> and <hi>grievous commands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Man is to be conſidered as in a <hi>regenerate</hi> ſtate, which yet is but the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Grace; for though the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath a perfection of <hi>parts,</hi> yet it hath not a perfection of <hi>degrees,</hi> there are remains of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:63179:62"/>
corruption in every part; though luſt be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throned,</hi> it is not <hi>ejected;</hi> though it hath loſt its <hi>regency,</hi> yet it retains a <hi>reſidence;</hi> it hath a great power, though not a reigning power; it hath the power of a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> though not of a <hi>King;</hi> and often <hi>captivates,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7.23.</note> though it don't <hi>command.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now though ſo far as Grace prevails, the command of Chriſt is no <hi>Yoke,</hi> no burden, no task; it is a pleaſure and delight;<note place="margin">Rom. 7.22.</note> it is no more a <hi>Yoke</hi> than it is to an Angel in Heaven, or than it was to Chriſt. Is it a <hi>Yoke</hi> to a man to eat and drink, to take his meals, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his hunger? No more is it to the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nature to obey the will of God. <hi>I delight to do thy will, O my God,</hi> Pſal. 40.8. yet ſo far as corruption remains unſubdued and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified in a child of God, ſo far the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Chriſt are a <hi>yoke</hi> ſtill; for though <hi>with the mind</hi> he ſerves the <hi>Law of God,</hi> yet <hi>with the fleſh</hi> he ſerves <hi>the Law of ſin,</hi> Rom. 7.25. the <hi>body of death</hi> will not bear the <hi>yoke</hi> of the <hi>Lord of life.</hi> And this is the reaſon why the Soul ſo oft crys out and complains of it, becauſe it oppoſes and hinders that ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to Jeſus Chriſt, which the Soul longs and labours to come up to. He would be <hi>holy as God is holy,</hi> that he might ſtand <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat to all the will of God;</hi> but he finds a Law, that <hi>when he would do good evil is preſent.</hi> Rom. 7.21.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The commands of Chriſt are called a <hi>Yoke</hi> with reſpect to the nature of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands themſelves, which lay the ſtrongeſt

obligation upon the Creature, both as to Sin and Grace.</p>
               <p>Firſt, As to Sin: it injoyns the mortifying every luſt, and that upon pain of eternal death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As to Grace; it requires the getting of grace, the growing in grace, the exerciſe of grace, and that through the whole courſe of our lives.</p>
               <p>No ſuch tye upon the Soul as the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt; therefore ſome ſay <hi>Religio</hi> is <hi>à reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gando,</hi> it is the tye of God upon the Soul; till a man comes under the power of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, he is <gap reason="foreign">

               </argument>
               <p n="2">2. WHY it is the concernment of every one to take up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt in his Youth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe of the Call of God. He doth not call us to bow to his <hi>Yoke,</hi> to ſubmit to his Authority, to obey his Commands on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but to do it betimes; as he ſtates our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>what</hi> we ſhall do, ſo he times it, <hi>when</hi> it muſt be done. And therefore it is as much a ſin to let ſlip the time, as to neglect the thing. Not to do <hi>what</hi> God commands is a ſin, and not to do it <hi>when</hi> God commands it,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:63179:63"/>
is another ſin. If God ſays, <hi>To day, go work to day in my vineyard</hi> (Mat. 21.28.) <hi>To day if you will hear his voice harden not your hearts</hi> (Heb. 3.15.) Why then to put it off till the morrow, is a ſin, and ſo the adding of one days neglect to another, is the adding of ſin to ſin: For it is a repeated ſlight to the Call of God. Now to ſhew you the force of this reaſon, do but conſider who it is that calls, and what the Call is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Who it is that calls, it is God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is God the Father; he that made thee, and gave thee thy being. And this, one would think, ſhould be obligation enough to duty. He that gave thee thy being calls for thy obedience: eſpecially conſidering he made thee for this end; other Creatures were made to ſerve thee; but there was no end of thy being but to ſerve God; and therefore thou hadſt another make tnan other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. He ſtamped a greater excellency upon man than upon the reſt of the Creatures: Every Creature bears ſome <hi>impreſſion</hi> of God, but no Creature on earth but only Man bears the <hi>likeneſs</hi> of God. In other Creatures there are <hi>veſtigia Dei,</hi> but in man only there is <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go Dei,</hi> there you may ſee his <hi>footſteps,</hi> but here only his <hi>image.</hi> Other Creatures are formed of earth, but Man is partly earth and partly Heaven; the duſt of the earth is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the breath of God. And why ſuch an excellent being, but to fit him for the end to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:63179:64"/>
which God deſigned him, <hi>viz.</hi> Duty and Service.</p>
               <p>And is it not reaſon that God who gave thee thy being ſhould have thy obedience? That he who gave thee a reaſonable Soul ſhould have a reaſonable ſervice? Creation is an obligation to ſervice. Hence that of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 12.1. <hi>Remember thy Creator.</hi> He that was not made by himſelf ſhould not live to himſelf. He that can't ceaſe from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on God as a Principle, he ought not to ceaſe from intending God as an end, that he may be the object of our obedience, as well as the Author of our being.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is God the Son, the Lord thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is he that took up fleſh, came into thy Nature, was made Man, became thy Surety, bore the Curſe due to thy ſins, ſhed his Blood, laid down his life to ranſom thy Soul, roſe again for thy Juſtification, is gone to Heaven upon thy Errand. It is this Chriſt that calls thee to take up his <hi>Yoke;</hi> and is it not reaſon that we ſhould bear the <hi>Yoke</hi> for him that bore the <hi>Croſs</hi> and the <hi>Curſe</hi> for us? Is it not reaſon that if we have the good of his Sufferings, he ſhould have the glory of our ſervice?</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is he that with the Father hath ſtabliſhed this as the great Condition of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>bearing the Yoke:</hi> ſo that it is the ſtanding Law of Heaven, Whoever will be ſaved muſt take up Chriſts <hi>Yoke.</hi> This is the way to bleſſedneſs, and there is no other;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:63179:64"/>
bear the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt and be bleſſed; caſt that off and Chriſt will caſt you off, ſubmit and be ſaved, reject it and Chriſt will reject you. This is the unalterable condition of Salvation, and there is no other. Things are ſo ſetled in the eternal Compact between Father and Son about the caſe of man, that the Blood of Chriſt it ſelf cannot ſtead us, nor the mercy of God (infinite as it is) benefit us,<note place="margin">Per legem, per crucem, per lucem, per concili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, per af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flatum &amp; auxilium. <hi>See</hi> Pareus in Revel. <hi>3.20.</hi>
                  </note> without this condition be performed by us. And therefore it is that Chriſt is ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate in this Duty, that he calls and knocks, ſo many ways, by the Law, by the Croſs, by Goſpel-light, by the operation of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is he that made this his great end in redeeming us, to reſtore us to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as well as to favour; and to render us capable of that ſervice and duty which hath Glory and Bleſſedneſs annexed to it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Blood is ſaid to <hi>purge the conſcience from dead works to ſerve the living God,</hi> Heb. 9 14. And this is made a reaſon of his bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſins in his body on the tree, <hi>that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead to ſin might live to righteouſnſs,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.24.</p>
               <p>And who did he redeem? was it not young ones as well as others? Did he not ſhed as much blood, and pay as great a price for them as others?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is he that hath purchaſed unto himſelf a fulneſs of Grace to be given forth for the inablement of thee for the ſuſception of this <hi>Yoke,</hi> and the performing all the Duties
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:63179:65"/>
belonging thereto; ſo that there ſhall be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wanting, if there be but a willing mind. The Lord Chriſt knows thy caſe, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency contracted by ſin; that thou canſt not bear his <hi>Yoke</hi> without his ſtrength, and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of his Grace; and therefore he calls thee to partake of his fulneſs, that thou mayſt <hi>be ſtrong in the Lord and in the power of his might.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The wiſe God permitted the loſs of mans ſelf-fulneſs, that he might never more be any thing in himſelf, but might glorifie the Redeemer by an intire conſtant dependance upon him in fetching all from him as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent Creature. Mans firſt miſcarriage was in a deſire of ſelf-ſufficiency, and he hath been poor and naked from that very day. He would have a ſtock in his own hands, and he hath been a begger ever ſince. It was pride at the firſt that overthrew him, and ever ſince God hath left ſin in him to humble him. He would have a happineſs in himſelf, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhall have no happineſs but by being outed of himſelf. He would live as an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Being, and therefore to cure this, God brings him to an abſolute dependance for all things; he ſhall have nothing but what he hath by faith and expectation, that he may thereby ſee what a beggerly indigent Creature he is, and ſo glorifie the fulneſs of Chriſt. And it is the mercy of Chriſt that he hath a ſufficiency of Grace for all that ſee their need, and truſt to his ſupplies. And therefore it is all the reaſon in the world we ſhould obey his Call, and take up his <hi>Yoke,</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:63179:65"/>
who injoyns no obedience but what he gives ſtrength and power to perform.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, It is he into whoſe hand the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World is committed, <hi>he is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God, to be the Judge of quick and dead,</hi> Acts 10.42. And this is what you all profeſs to believe, you ſay in your Creed, that <hi>he is aſcended into heaven, and from thence he ſhall come to judge the quick and the dead;</hi> and it is ſo, for <hi>the Father hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all judgment to the Son,</hi> John 5.22. He it is who diſpoſes of all perſons to their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal condition, the power of life and death, ſalvation and damnation is in his hand. He is the <hi>Husbandman</hi> who appoints the <hi>reapers</hi> to <hi>gather the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them, but to gather the wheat into his barn, Mat.</hi> 13.30. He is the Bridegroom who takes the <hi>wiſe Virgins in</hi> with him <hi>to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,</hi> but excludes <hi>the fooliſh.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 25.10. Mat. 25.14.</note> He is the man who travelling into a far Country, delivered his goods to his ſervants, <hi>to one five talents,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>to another two, to another one,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 19.</note> and <hi>after a long time comes againe and reckons with them,</hi> bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and rewarding the diligence of the <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">v. 31.</note> and dooming the <hi>unprofitable ſervant into utter darkneſs.</hi>

               <p>And is there not great reaſon then why every one ſhould take up his <hi>Yoke;</hi> eſpecially conſidering that it is made up of thoſe Laws that are the rules both of his Government and of his Judgment; as he rules by them, ſo he will paſs Sentence by them, the ſame Laws that are now given by Chriſt for a rule of life,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:63179:66"/>
ſhall then be the rule of Judgment. Our Lord Chriſt tells you ſo, <hi>John</hi> 12.48. <hi>He that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him, the words that I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, the ſame ſhall judge him in the laſt day.</hi> If you will not ſubmit to his word to <hi>guide</hi> you, you muſt ſubmit to it to <hi>try</hi> you; you may decline his <hi>Precepts,</hi> but you cannot decline his <hi>Sentence.</hi> You will not obey him when he ſays,<note place="margin">Mat. 16.24.</note>

               <p n="3">3. God the Holy Spirit, he calls for thy obedience and for an early ſubmiſſion to the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt; and therefore it is that he begins his work in the Soul betimes. I know not, nor is it for me to ſay, how early, but certainly it is very early. There are none of you of any competent age but the Spirit of the Lord hath been dealing with you to bring you under the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt<note n="*" place="margin">Among ſuch as are religiouſly educated, there is ſcarce a child of ten years old but the holy Spirit hath been at work in his heart. <hi>Increaſe Mather,</hi> in his Book about Converſion, <hi>pag.</hi> 134.</note>. The Goſpel is <hi>the miniſtration of the Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.8. and the Call of the Goſpel is accompanied with a work of the Spirit; where the Goſpel <hi>calls outwardly,</hi> the Spirit <hi>calls inwardly,</hi> and this is the higheſt way of Gods calling. There is no work of God beyond the ſtriving of the Spirit in the heart: and doubtleſs the Spirit ſtrives leſs or more with all under the word. He cannot be ſaid to ſtrive with all in the

ſame manner, nor in all with equal power and efficacy; for then all would as well be brought under Chriſts <hi>Yoke</hi> as thoſe that are. But that he ſtrives with all in one degree or other is evident. For whence is it that many are under ſuch frequent and ſtrong convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? and that they are made to ſee ſin, and feel the burden of it? convinced of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done condition under it? convinced of the neceſſity and equity of obedience and a holy life? it is from the ſtriving of the Spirit.

How could he be reſiſted, if he did not put forth his power, and ſtrive with the ſinner? Reſiſtance is a forcible op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition made by one againſt another in his onſets and attempts: So that it is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the Spirit of the Lord ſtrives with all, to bring them under the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt at one time or other. Now I pray do but conſider what reaſon there is for your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the Spirit herein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Conſider what his work and deſign is. It is to prepare the way of the Lord into the heart, to break the <hi>Yoke</hi> of ſin, to deſtroy that confederacy with corruption, which will be the ruine of thy Soul, and ſo to captivate the heart to the obedience of Chriſt. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever means he uſes, this is the end he purſues. If he wound us, if he break us, if he empty and out us of our ſelves, it is but to bring us to a more ready and free ſubjection to the Laws of Chriſt. Wounds of Conſcience are painful things, and ſpiritual troubles are grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous troubles, the burden of ſin is a heavy burden; but ſo long as theſe things are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the management of the Spirit as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to a ready obedience to the Lord Chriſt, there is all the reaſon in the world why you ſhould undergo them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let it be conſidered how uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his ſtriving is, you don't know how long or how little while it will laſt. He begins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, but you know not how ſoon he may have done. If you refuſe his calls, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:63179:67"/>
him when he knocks, you have no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe he will knock again. To be ſure, the more you reſiſt him, the ſooner you quench him, and where he is once utterly quenched, there he never ſtrives again. Where it is quenched but partially and gradually, it is a very hard thing to kindle it again, as you may ſee <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.6. but where it is totally quenched it can be kindled no more. Alas who ſhould kindle it?</p>
               <p>The Saints can't: <hi>Call now if there be any that will anſwer thee, and to which of the Saints wilt thou turn?</hi> (as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſaid to <hi>Job</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe) <hi>Job</hi> 5.1. Could the <hi>wiſe Virgins</hi> kindle the <hi>fooliſh Virgins</hi> lamps when they were gone out? no they could not: <hi>Give us of your oyl, for our lamps are gone out,</hi> Mat. 25.8. but alas they had none to ſpare: <hi>Not ſo, leſt there be not enough for us and you,</hi> v. 9.</p>
               <p>Can the ſinner himſelf kindle it? no, that is impoſſible; he can quench it, but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not kindle it. He may ſin away the Spirits motions, but he can never recover them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. That is plain in <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24, 25. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I called and you refuſed, I ſtretched out my hand and no man regarded, but ye have ſet at nought all my counſel,</hi> &amp;c. Here is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit quenched; and ſee how they ſtrive to light it again, but in vain. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 28. <hi>They ſhall call upon me, but I will not anſwer, they ſhall ſeek me early, but ſhall not find me.</hi> The ſinner, you ſee, can quench the Spirit, but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not kindle it.</p>
               <p>Can the Ordinances kindle it again? no
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:63179:68"/>
neither. Alas how ſhould they, when they have no life in themſelves, but what the Spirit puts into them? Pray mind, if you at any time quench the Spirit in your ſelves, you do thereby quench it in all the Ordinances; and then though the Word be otherwiſe <hi>the word of life,</hi> yet it is but a <hi>dead letter</hi> when the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is quenched. None can kindle it again but God, and he will not. Where the ſinner doth once totally extinguiſh it, God will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver light it again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If it once come to this, you can never come to Chriſt, never take up his <hi>Yoke.</hi> For this is a work that can never be done without the help of the Spirit. If he muſt help the Believers <hi>infirmities,</hi> then ſure he muſt cure the Sinners <hi>obſtinacies;</hi> there is a <hi>yoke</hi> to be <hi>broke off,</hi> as well as a <hi>yoke</hi> to be <hi>put on;</hi> corrupt habits to be extirpated, or obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Chriſt can never be owned: And this is a work that none but the Spirit of God can effect. <hi>The yoke ſhall be deſtroyed becauſe of the anointing.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 10.27.</note> Though that be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the <hi>Aſſyrians yoke,</hi> yet it is typical of ſins <hi>yoke,</hi> which none can free thee from but the Spirit of Chriſt; and therefore if the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit depart thou art undone, there is no poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of converſion to Chriſt; thou art given up to a perpetual vaſſalage to ſin and luſt, and to an hardned refuſal of all the counſels of God, and of all the ways of life. So that upon all theſe accounts it is highly reaſonable that every one of you ſhould ſtoop to the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt betimes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:63179:68"/>The Spirit of the Lord calls you to this, the end of all his motions and ſtrivings is to bring you to this. And how little while he may ſtrive you don't know. And if he once give over ſtriving, the work can never be done.</p>
               <p>Here then you ſee the reaſon why every one ſhould take up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt in his youth, becauſe of the Call of God. <hi>God the Father</hi> calls who made thee, <hi>God the Son</hi> calls who redeemed thee, <hi>God the Spirit</hi> calls who was ſent to counſel and guide thee, to rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate and change thee, to ſanctifie and make thee meet for Glory. And ſhall not the Call of God be obeyed? This one thing will make it appear to be the moſt reaſonable thing in the world, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Covenant you are entred into; are not you entred into a Covenant with God the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt? What is your Baptiſm but a token and pledge of it? Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God hath owned you for his; and hereby you are ingaged to be the Lord's. And ſhall God take me into Covenant, and ſhall I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to take up Chriſts <hi>Yoke?</hi> This is that will deſtroy your Covenant-intereſt. God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects that ſo ſoon as you come to years of underſtanding, to know your intereſt and duty, you ſhould renew the Covenant of God upon your own Souls, and take hold of it for your ſelves (as your Parents did for you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.) Now wherein doth your perſonal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into Covenant with God chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, but in your taking up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt?
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:63179:69"/>
Sure therefore this ſhould be done betimes; if you refuſe this, ye renounce your Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, you caſt your ſelves out by your unbelief, and then God will caſt you out: <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20. <hi>Becauſe of unbelief they were broken off.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider what this Call is. When you are called to take up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt, you are called from a ſtate of ſin and miſery to a ſtate of true bleſſedneſs; from the vileſt ſlavery and drudgery in the world, to a work of the higheſt pleaſure and delight.<note place="margin">Prov. 3.17.</note> No great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er pleaſure than in duty and obedience where the heart is right with God. You are called to holineſs, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.7. <hi>God hath not called us to uncleanneſs, but unto holineſs.</hi> And a life of holineſs is the moſt deſirable life in the world, it is the life of God; it is that life in which only a man can have communion with God; for a man muſt partake of the nature and life of God that would have fellowſhip with God; contrary natures can have no communion, He will not take the wicked by the hand<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Job</hi> 8.20.</note>. <hi>Without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12.14. It is not meant only of ſeeing God in Heaven, but in this world alſo, for there is a ſeeing of God <hi>fiducially</hi> as well as <hi>beatifically,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 5.8. Heb. 11.27.</note> and the one is as neceſſary to the preſent ſtate, as the other is to a ſtate of Glory. And he that doth not ſee God in this world, ſhall never ſee him in the next. Now that which fits for preſent Viſion and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:63179:69"/>
Communion is holineſs. And your holineſs lies in taking up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming to the Law and Will of Chriſt. This is that which you are called to: Nay when you are called to take up Chriſt's <hi>Yoke,</hi> you are therein called to partake of the glory and bleſſedneſs of Chriſt in Heaven. For though this Call of God begins in <hi>Grace,</hi> yet it ends in <hi>Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a twofold end of Gods Call with reſpect to ſinners, the near and proximate end is the converſion of ſinners to Chriſt, and a life of obedience; the remote and ultimate end is the bringing thoſe to glory who are thus brought home by grace, and therefore the Call of God is ſaid to be to glory, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.12.—<hi>who hath called you to his kingdom and glory.</hi> And 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. <hi>called us to glory and virtue.</hi> To <hi>virtue</hi> as the means, to <hi>glory</hi> as the end. The call begins in converſion, it is carried on in ſanctification and obedience, it is compleated in glory and bleſſedneſs. <hi>Whom he called them he juſtified,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>,</note> 
                  <hi>whom he juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them he alſo glorified:</hi> It is not ſaid whom he juſtified them he alſo ſanctified (which the order of things would ſeem to require) I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the reaſon is, becauſe ſanctification is included in glorification, for it is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of glory; and therefore is ſo called in Scripture, <hi>We all with open face beholding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord are changed into the ſame image from glory to glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. <hi>i. e.</hi> from one degree of grace to another, till grace be at laſt compleated in glory. The
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:63179:70"/>
eternal dignifying the ſoul with the glory of God is the ultimate end of the call of God.</p>
               <p>So that to conſider who it is that calls, and what this call is, adds a great force to the reaſon, why every one ſhould <hi>take up the Yoke of Chriſt in his youth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Becauſe of the nature of ſin, which gets great advantage by its continuance and uncontrouled poſſeſſion. It inſinuates it ſelf into the affections by its inticing pleaſures and deceiving delights; and when the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are ingaged, it is hard to diſintangle them. What ſhall reduce that Soul from compliance with ſin, which is linked to it by love and delight? The power and ſtrength which ſin hath in us is by its intereſt in the affections; hereby it ſteals into the Throne inſenſibly, and ſo gives Law to the whole man. And how ſhall a man ſtoop to the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt who is under the power and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of luſt?<note place="margin">Mat. 6.24.</note> 
                  <hi>No man can ſerve</hi> theſe <hi>two ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</hi> Therefore it is good to ſhake off the <hi>Yoke</hi> of ſin betimes, becauſe of its incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature; it goes on by little and little and by repeated and multiplied acts, it becomes a habit in the Soul; and it is a very difficult thing to remove a habit: as it is with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, which taken at firſt may be eaſily cured; but when by a long tract of time it hath cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the blood, and ſetled it ſelf in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, it is then turned to an ill habit, and then the remedies, which might have done at firſt, come too late. <hi>Bernard</hi> tells us of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſteps and gradations by which a man
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:63179:70"/>
comes to the higheſt degree of ſin; <hi>firſt ſin is heavy, then leſs heavy, then light, then ſweet, at length natural and unavoidable; ſo that what at firſt was difficult to be done, is at laſt impoſſible to be left undone.</hi> The carnal heart is the ſeat of luſt, luſt works to ſinful acts,<note place="margin">Jam. 1.13.</note> ſinful acts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated make a cuſtom, and out of cuſtom not reſiſted, iſſues neceſſity. Hence that of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Having eyes full of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and that cannot ceaſe from ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus ſin incroaches by degrees, and by multiplied acts gathers more ſtrength, till at laſt it becomes unconquerable. Like many waters, which, meeting in one ſtream, ſwell to that greatneſs, that they overflow the banks and bear down all before them.

Of all that were poſſeſſed with evil Spirits in Chriſt's time, it is obſerved that none were ſo hardly cured as they that had been poſſeſſed from their child-hood, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.21, 29. Satan will not eaſily quit his hold, eſpecially where he hath had a long and quiet poſſeſſion. How ſeldom doth grace graft upon a withered ſtock!

                  <note place="margin">Eph. 4 19.</note> like the hand that is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by much labour. And how hard muſt the converſion of ſuch an one be! If it be a work of great difficulty to convert a <hi>hard heart</hi> which is in every man by nature, what a difficulty is it then to convert a <hi>heart hardned</hi> by cuſtom and continuance in ſin? Of all Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners there is leaſt hope of doing good upon thoſe, who, by conſtant evil uſages, have contracted ſuch a hardneſs, that they can ſin without fear, or regret of Conſcience. <hi>Pliny</hi> ſays of the <hi>Tortoiſe,</hi> that ſhe floats ſo long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the water, till the beams of the Sun have ſo hardned her ſhell, that ſhe cannot ſink; ſo going on in ſin under the Sun-ſhine of the Goſpel, doth ſo harden the heart that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not repent.

                  <hi>I will not, not caſt him out.</hi> The promiſe doth not only import the ſafety of the eſtate of ſuch as are in Chriſt, but the welcome reception of all that come to Chriſt. As he will not <hi>caſt them out</hi> that are once united to him, ſo, nor will he <hi>keep them out</hi> who deſire truly to cloſe with him whenever it be, ſooner or later; when ever the heart is willing God is ready. A ſincere obedience ſhall find acceptance at any time; but the earlier we come, the kinder ſhall be our reception, and the greater our welcome; and it muſt needs be ſo,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe we reſiſt the fewer calls and invitations of God, which are the expreſſions of his love and good will to ſinners; and as nothing provokes God more than when his love is ſlighted, ſo there is nothing he is more pleaſed with than when the Soul is won by it to a readineſs of obedience; and that which pleaſes God heightens our acceptation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We ſave God the labour (to ſpeak after the manner of men) of uſing other means in which he leſs delights; there are methods which God doth not love to be found in the uſe of, which yet he is conſtrained to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:63179:72"/>
uſe for our benefit; he hath his <hi>thorn hedges</hi> to ſtop our courſe, reduce our wandrings, and bring us to himſelf: hence we read of his <hi>ſtrange works</hi> and his <hi>ſtrange acts,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hoſ. 2.6, 7.</note> Iſa. 28.21. Things which God delights not in, but is forced to by the ſtubbornneſs of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that he that will not <hi>hear the word</hi> and who hath <hi>ordained</hi> it, may be made to <hi>hear the rod and who hath appointed it,</hi> Mic. 6.9. Now by early imbracing the ways of Chriſt, we happily prevent God in that work which is ſo contrary to his diſpoſition, as being more inclined to mercy than wrath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We gratifie him in the thing he loves; and that is, an early obedience. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law all Sacrifices were required to be young. <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.19. <hi>All the firſtling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock, thou ſhalt ſanctifie unto the Lord thy God.</hi> And <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.29. <hi>Thou ſhalt not delay to offer the firſt of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors.</hi> Mark, It muſt be the <hi>firſtling</hi> of the herd, and the <hi>firſtling</hi> of the flock, and the <hi>firſt ripe fruits,</hi> and the <hi>firſt liquors.</hi> And why? but to teach us, by theſe Types, how pleaſing to God a timely converſion is; and that if we would preſent our ſelves an acceptable Sacrifice to him, it muſt be by an early ſubjection to the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt. He loves a young <hi>Abijah,</hi> a young <hi>Joſiah,</hi> a young <hi>Timothy,</hi> a young Saint for a Sacrifice.<note place="margin">Joh. 20.2. Chap. 21.20.</note> 
                  <hi>John</hi> is called <hi>the Diſciple whom Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus loved,</hi> Joh. 13.23. And why? did Jeſus love none other of the Diſciples but him? Yes, he loved them all, and that both living

All which ſhews the gracious acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance of his early obedience.</p>
               <p>It addeth greatly to the value of a gift when it is given readily and at firſt asking. So when we give up our ſelves to the Call of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhifting and hucking, without demurrs and delays, it puts a great value upon our obedience, and makes it the more accepted with God.

of God, till by judgment upon judgment he makes them weary of their communion, and plagues them out of them; the ſmart of Gods rod, the coming of the evil day, the waſtes of nature, the decay of ſtrength, the growth of diſeaſes, the proſpect of another world, the ſenſe of a polluted nature, a corrupt heart, and a miſpent life, the fore-taſtes of the wrath of God; theſe, ſet home by the Spirit, may create ſuch terrors in the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as may weary a ſinner out of his luſts, and bring him to Chriſt at laſt; but he ſhall not have that welcome as the early Convert hath. He ſhall be received and entertained, but not made ſo much of as if he had come ſooner. He ſhall not have thoſe comforts that an earlier Convert feels, who took up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt betimes, and ſo hath walked in the fear of the Lord all his days.

               <p>Or if he meets with comfort in this life, it may be long firſt, and coſt him many prayers and many tears, much wooing and much waiting. Though Chriſt, when he <hi>ſtands at the door and knocks,</hi> promiſes, that <hi>if any man opens, he ſhall ſup with him,</hi> Revel. 3.20. Yet if Chriſt wait long for entrance, the Soul may be made to wait long for its entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If his own Spouſe deny him entrance,

he'l deny her his preſence; if ſhe ſuffers him to knock and call without admittance, he will ſuffer her to ſeek and ſue for a time, without ſucceſs, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2, 3, 6.

The life of man conſiſts of three parts, <hi>Infancy, Youth, and Old age,</hi> and of all, this is the moſt proper; and therefore the duty here is not commended to the firſt part of life, for <hi>Infancy</hi> is too ſoon to <hi>know</hi> God, when we cannot <hi>know</hi> our ſelves; nor is it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the third, for <hi>Old age</hi> is too late to <hi>ſerve</hi> God when we cannot <hi>ſerve</hi> our ſelves; but it is commended to the time of <hi>Youth,</hi> that being the moſt proper ſeaſon for ſervice and obedience.

               <p>Firſt, Whether ye look to the indiſpoſition that delays work to. The longer ſin hath poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, the faſter it will rivet it ſelf to the Soul, and ſo ſtrengthen it ſelf and harden the heart againſt converſion; and therefore he that is unwilling to be ſubject to Chriſt to day, will be more unwilling to morrow. Or</p>
               <p>Secondly, Whether ye look to the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain duration of life; it is not only ſhort at beſt, but uncertain; no man knows either how, or where, or when he ſhall dye. <hi>I am old</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iſaac) and know not the day of my death,</hi> Gen. 27.2. He hath no ſecurity of living another day; the body is ſubject to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:63179:75"/>
above three hundred diſeaſes, and to as many thouſand caſualties. One hour may diſpatch thee into another world as well as a year; a tile from the houſe may be as mortal as a diſeaſe; a flye, a hair, or a raiſin-ſtone may end thy days as certainly as a Plague or Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. One dyes eating, another drinking, another laughing, another weeping, another walking, another praying, another curſing and ſwearing; one dyes at an Ordinance of God, another at a Play-houſe, one of the Devils great Ordinances. One dyes at Sea, another at ſhore. One asking a Sea-man where his father dyed, ſaith he, at Sea; and where dyed your Grandfather? ſays he, at Sea; I wonder then, ſaid he, why you will venture to go to Sea. The Sea-man asked him, Where dyed your father? He anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, In his bed; and where dyed your Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father? He anſwered, In his bed too; why then, ſaid the Sea-man, I wonder you will venture to go to bed. There is death in the <hi>bed</hi> as well as on <hi>board.</hi> Death will find a man where-ever he is; and how can a man that ſeriouſly conſiders the uncertainty of life, delay cloſing with the Call of God one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, leſt death ſurprize him in an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted condition? Would any of you be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to go out of the world in a ſtate of enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God, and to launch into Eternity in an unpardoned ſtate? Hath God ever told you you ſhall live to old age, that you dare defer your converſion till then? Hath God ſaid you ſhall not dye next ſickneſs, or the next voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:63179:76"/>
you take, or the next time you go out of doors? Do not you ſee twenty dye young to one that lives to old age? And why may not you? If God had told you that ſo many years you ſhall continue in the world, this might be a temptation to you to entertain your luſts a little longer, and put off the thoughts of turning to God till hereafter; but God hath in his Wiſdom hid from us our laſt day,<note place="margin">Ideò latet ultimus dies, ut ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerventur omnes.</note> that we might thereby be ſtirred up to watch eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, and do the great work out of hand for which we came into the world.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is very dangerous, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſhortneſs and uncertainty of the day of grace; the time of life is ſhort, but the day of grace may be ſhorter; it is the counſel of our Lord, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.35. <hi>Yet a little while the light is with you, walk while ye have the light, lest darkneſs come upon you.</hi> The words imply three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the ſeaſon of Grace is but ſhort, it continues but for a little while.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it is a great Duty to improve it while we have it. <hi>Walk while you have the light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. They that have it and do not improve it, may ſoon be deprived of it. <hi>Leſt darkneſs come upon you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a <hi>general</hi> and a <hi>particular</hi> day of Grace. The general day of Grace is when the Goſpel is brought to a people, and the Miniſtry of it ſet up by God, whereby life and ſalvation is tendred to all in the blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:63179:76"/>The particular and ſpecial day of Grace is, when the Goſpel is not only preached, and Salvation tendred, but when the Spirit of the Lord doth accompany it, and carry it home to the hearts of ſinners, ſometimes inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their minds, ſometimes convincing their conſciences, ſometimes working inward fears and terrors from a ſenſe of their undone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſometimes ſtirring up good affections and deſires, ſometimes working them to ſtrong purpoſes and reſolutions to repent, and turn and obey. Now where the Spirit doth thus inwardly ſtrive with any ſinner, that is his particular day of grace, his ſpecial ſeaſon of finding and obtaining mercy. <hi>Seek the Lord while he may be found,</hi> Iſai. 55.6. <hi>Now is the accepted time, now is the day of ſalvation,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. If ever a ſinner be converted and brought into obedience to Jeſus Chriſt, this is the time. And it is very dangerous to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect or defer our cloſing with Chriſt, for it is very uncertain how long or how little while the opportunity may be afforded. Who knows when his day of grace begins, or when it will end?<note place="margin">Job 14.5.</note> As no man knows the number of his months; ſo, much leſs doth he know the length of his day of grace.<note place="margin">Acts 1.7.</note> 
                  <hi>It is not for you</hi> (as Chriſt ſays in another caſe) <hi>to know the times and the ſeaſons which the Father hath kept in his own power.</hi> And the reaſon why God hides it from us may be, becauſe he would have us loſe no opportunity of ſaving our Souls, but imbrace the firſt tenders of mercy, leſt God ſhould take our refuſal, and never
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:63179:77"/>
tender it more. If you repulſe the Spirit of God when he knocks, you have no promiſe that ever he will knock again; and if he leaves off, you are undone for ever. <hi>The har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt is paſt, the ſummer is ended, and we are not ſaved,</hi> Jer. 8.20. God will not wait long upon a lingring ſinner; he takes delays for denials, and ſo departs, and the day of grace ends. Moſt certain it is that the day of grace may be ſinned away, and that whether you conſider it in the general, or particular no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Take it in the general notion of it, for the injoyment of the means of grace, and the Miniſtry of the Word and Ordinances; and this may ceaſe. God may deprive a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a converting Miniſtry and converting Ordinances, and may give them Statutes not good, as he did to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Ezek. 20.24, 25. <hi>Becauſe they deſpiſed my ſtatutes, polluted my Sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers idols, therefore I gave them</hi> (or gave them up to) <hi>ſtatutes that were not good, and judgments whereby they ſhould not live.</hi> It is a judicial proceſs of an offended God becauſe of abuſed mercies; they had the Statutes and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Ordinances of God which were juſt and good, and tended to life, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. But becauſe they ſlighted theſe, therefore he gave them up to the Statutes and ſuperſtitious Inventions of men, which were <hi>not good,</hi> but tended to death and deſtruction.</p>
               <p>It is a dreadful judgment when for ſlighting and rebelling againſt the Statutes and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:63179:77"/>
of God, he gives a perſon or a people up to <hi>Statutes and judgments that are not good.</hi> And this ſeems to be the very judgment that God is giving this Nation up to at this day; we have ſlighted the <hi>Yoke of Chriſt,</hi> and therefore he is giving us up to the <hi>Yoke of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt;</hi> we have been weary of pure Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Ordinances, and have been luſting after the <hi>Romiſh</hi> inventions, and therefore the righteous God ſeems to be giving us up to them, and ſaying to us as to that people, <hi>v.</hi> 39. <hi>As for you, O houſe of Iſrael, thus ſaith the Lord God, go ye, ſerve ye every one his Idols.</hi> When men will not ſtoop to, nor owne thoſe ways of Chriſt which are <hi>for their good,</hi> it is juſt with God to give them up to thoſe ways that are <hi>not for their good.</hi> When <hi>men receive not the love of the truth that they may be ſaved, for this cauſe God ſends them ſtrong deluſions that they ſhould believe a lye, and be damned,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2.10, 11, 12. And theſe are the <hi>Statutes that are not good, and the judgments whereby they ſhall not live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes he gives them up to a <hi>blind</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, <hi>the ſword of the Lord is upon the arm and the right eye of the Idol-ſhepherd,</hi> inſomuch that <hi>his arm is dried up, and his right eye utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly darkned,</hi> Zach. 11.17. He cloſeth the eyes of the <hi>Prophets, and Rulers, and Seers</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>a spirit of deep ſleep,</hi> ſo that <hi>the viſion of all is become as the words of a book ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> which neither <hi>unlearned</hi> nor <hi>learned</hi> can read, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 29.10, 11, 12.</p>
               <p>Sometimes he gives them up to a <hi>profane</hi>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:63179:78"/>
and <hi>debauched</hi> Miniſtry; <hi>The Prieſt and the Prophet have erred through ſtrong drink, they are ſwallowed up of wine, through ſtrong drink they erre in viſion and ſtumble in judgment,</hi> Iſai. 28.7. <hi>From the Prophets of Jeruſalem is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs gone forth into all the land,</hi> Jer. 23.15. <hi>They cauſe my people to erre by their lies and by their lightneſs,</hi> v. 32.</p>
               <p>Sometimes he doth utterly take away his Ordinances, and means of Grace. <hi>Behold, ſaith the Lord, the days come that I will ſend a famine in the land, not a famine of bread</hi> (which yet is a ſore judgment, and makes the <hi>mother eat the child of a ſpan long,</hi> Lam. 2.20.) <hi>nor a thirſt for water,</hi> (for a draught whereof <hi>Lyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus,</hi> to ſave his life, ſold his Kingdom) <hi>but of hearing the word of the Lord.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Amos 8.11.</note> And this was the judgment of God upon <hi>Iſrael: We ſee not our ſigns, there is no more any Prophet, neither is there any among us that knoweth how long,</hi> Pſal. 74.9. <hi>Amaziah</hi> and his Courtiers ſhall not need to pack away the Prophets, and forbid them preaching nigh the Court (as <hi>Amos</hi> 7.12.) for God will, as a woful Plague to an unworthy people, remove them. And <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be <hi>without the true God, and without a teaching Prieſt, and without Law,</hi> 2 Chron. 15.3. And this is what our Lord Chriſt ſo ſeverely threatned, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.43. <hi>The kingdom of God ſhall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</hi> And how ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath this word been accompliſhed upon them for ſixteen hundred years together. The ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> as alſo thoſe of <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:63179:78"/>
(that vaſt Continent (thrice as big as <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>) are ſad inſtances of this. It is plain then that the day of grace in regard of the injoyment of the Ordinances, may be ſinned away. But</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Sinners particular day of grace may be loſt and ſinned away; he may not only ſin away the Ordinances, but the ſtrivings of the Spirit too; he may reſiſt it till it is quenched, and ſo quench it, that it can never be kindled again. Many do in this ſenſe out-live their day of grace, by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away the motions and ſtrivings of the Spirit; for though he ſtrives long with many, and longer with ſome ſinners than others, yet he will not ſtrive always: <hi>The Lord ſaid, My Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive with man,</hi> Gen. 6.3. Nay the Spirit may not only ceaſe ſtriving when the Ordinances are removed, but he may ceaſe ſtriving while the Ordinances are continued, and then the day of grace is paſt, though the means of grace abide.</p>
               <p>The <hi>general</hi> and <hi>revealed</hi> day of grace may poſſibly laſt as long as life laſts, and the ſinner may ſit under the <hi>Gospel-call</hi> all his days, and yet the <hi>ſecret</hi> and <hi>particular</hi> day of grace may be ended; the Spirit may never ſtrive more, but leave the ſinner to his luſts. This is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by ſome, and hardly believed by any; let me therefore make it out, that ſo the danger of ſinning away your particular day of grace may be a prevailing reaſon why you ſhould mind Chriſt and his <hi>Yoke</hi> betimes, leſt you defer it till it be too late. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:63179:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
make out the truth of this five ways.</p>
               <p>Firſt, By the unerring evidence of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture inſtance. Was not <hi>Iſhmael</hi> a ſad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this truth? He was deſcended of a godly father, was in Covenant with God, had the Covenant-ſeal upon him,<note place="margin">Gen. 17.26.</note> injoyed all the means of grace; for <hi>Abraham</hi> was <hi>King, Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Prophet</hi> in his own houſe: And therefore he was not without the ſtrivings of the Spirit; and yet for all this he is caſt out of the Church, and out of Covenant. <hi>Cast him out,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.30. Now this caſting out, is a cutting him off, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving him (as a juſt puniſhment of his ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing ſpirit) of the means of grace,<note place="margin">Gen. 21.9. Gal. 4.29.</note> and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the ſtrivings of the Spirit of God. And this was done when he was not above <hi>twenty years</hi> old. Oh what a dreadful inſtance is this! How ſhould it awaken young ones that ſit under the means of grace, and fill them with trembling. Here is <hi>Iſhmael</hi> ſtanding out againſt the ſtrivings of the Spirit, and loſing his day of grace at <hi>twenty years</hi> of age. So that his day of grace laſted but few years; for he was thirteen years old when he was cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed,<note place="margin">Gen. 17.25.</note> and ſo ſealed with the Covenant-ſeal, and therefore he was but ſeven years under the priviledges of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>Now how old are you? How long have you been ſealed with the Covenant-ſeal? How long have you been under the means, and have had the Spirit ſtriving with you? Surely much longer than ever <hi>Iſhmael</hi> had; and therefore how dangerous is thy caſe, if
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:63179:79"/>
thou art not yet come under the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt!</p>
               <p>And what think ye of <hi>Eſau?</hi> Did not he ſin away and out-live his day of grace? Why elſe is it ſaid, <hi>That he would afterward have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited the bleſſing and was rejected. For he found no place for repentance, though he ſought it carefully with tears?</hi> Heb. 12.16, 17. His time for the bleſſing was paſt and gone, he came too late, and ſo loſt it; and was reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and no tears could recover it again. Now there is a great Myſtery in this, and it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs us in three great and concerning truths.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That by many the greateſt bleſſings are leſs minded than things of ſmaller moment. Here's <hi>Eſau</hi> preferring a <hi>morſel of meat</hi> before his <hi>birth-right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. To prefer temporal benefits before the greateſt ſpiritual bleſſings, is an evident ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of a profane ſpirit. For therefore <hi>Eſau</hi> is called <hi>a profane perſon,</hi> becauſe he ſold his <hi>birth-right</hi> (a Type of ſpiritual bleſſings) for a <hi>morſel of meat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. He that neglects to ſecure to himſelf ſpiritual bleſſings when they may be had, his judgment ſhall be, to ſeek and mourn after them, when it will be too late to find them. <hi>Eſau</hi> firſt ſells the bleſſing profanely, which God had beſtowed; and afterward ſeeks it with tears and is rejected. And when was this that <hi>Eſau</hi> thus profanely parts with his birth-right? It was very early, in the days of his youth. This is eaſily gathered from the ſtory
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:63179:80"/>
of his hunting, which ye have in <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.27. and ſo to the end of the Chapter, where it it ſaid, that <hi>the boys grew, and Eſau was a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hunter</hi> (v. 27.) and coming <hi>faint out of the field</hi> (v. 29.) he deſires his brother <hi>Jacob</hi> to feed him (<hi>v.</hi> 30.) <hi>Jacob</hi> offers him bread for his birth-right (<hi>v.</hi> 31.) <hi>Eſau</hi> being very faint, (<hi>at the point to die,</hi> the Text ſays (<hi>v.</hi> 32.) ſells him his birth-right for bread and pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. <hi>Thus Eſau deſpiſed his birth-right,</hi> v. 33. And this was very early, <hi>as ſoon as the boys were grown up.</hi> So that <hi>Eſau</hi> ſurvived his day of grace many years. The Spirit of the Lord left ſtriving with him betimes. And was it not the ſin of the poor Jews? Did not they out-live their day of grace?<note place="margin">Luke 19.44.</note> 
                  <hi>Oh that thou hadſt known in this thy day the things which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to thy peace, but now they are hid from thine eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, If a man may fall away from the Faith once profeſſed, and that totally and finally, then may he ſin away the ſtrivings of the Spirit, and ſo out-live his day of grace. Though a man cannot <hi>fall away</hi> from the <hi>work</hi> of grace <hi>finally,</hi> yet from the <hi>word</hi> of grace he may; though he cannot <hi>utterly depart</hi> from <hi>faith implanted,</hi> yet he may from the <hi>faith profeſſed.</hi> The Apoſtle ſays (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1.) That <hi>the Spirit ſpeaks expreſly that in the latter times ſome ſhall depart from the faith.</hi> Now when a man comes to depart from the Faith, the word of faith (the Scriptures) and the profeſſion of faith, and that finally, then the Spirit ſtrives no more; for his <hi>Conſcience</hi>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:63179:80"/>
(the next verſe tells you) is <hi>ſeared with a hot iron.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is evident in that God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times gives men up to their own luſts: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.11, 12. <hi>My people would not hearken to my voice, and Iſrael would none of me</hi> (had no will to me, ſo the Hebrew) and what follows?<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> So <hi>I gave them up to their own hearts luſts,</hi> and <hi>they walked in their own counſels.</hi> And what is it for God to give a man up to his luſts? but to let ſin and corruption have the whole rule and ſway in the Soul, without the wonted checks and reſtraints of the Spirit: This is called letting him alone in ſin. <hi>Ephraim is joyned to idols, let him alone,</hi> Hoſ. 4.17. that is, let him take his own courſe, and purſue his luſts, till God deal with him once for all.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It appears in that judicial hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, blindneſs, and impenitency that he gives ſome up to, which renders all the Ordinances utterly ineffectual; like rain falling upon a rock, that runs off without fruit. Nay in this caſe the Ordinances do not only not ſoften, but they harden; for where God hardens, every thing hardens; every word, every rod, every Ordinance, every Providence; every thing hath a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion ſo to do.<note place="margin">Rom. 11.8.</note> 
                  <hi>Make the heart of this people fat, make their ears heavy, ſhut their eyes, leſt they ſee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and underſtand with their heart, and convert and be healed,</hi> Iſai. 6.10. Ye read in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. of a threefold giving up: <hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>God gave
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:63179:81"/>
them up to uncleanneſs:</hi> v. 26. <hi>God gave them up to vile affections:</hi> v. 28. <hi>God gave them up to a reprobate mind.</hi> There is a gradation in this judicial proceſs of God. Here is the practice of ſin, and a giving up to that; then a love and delight in ſin, and a giving up to that; and at laſt a ſenſleſs ſtupidity in ſin, and then a giving up to that. And theſe are the three ſaddeſt judgments on this ſide Hell. God brought <hi>ten</hi> ſad Plagues upon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> but there was one greater than all, and that was a hardned heart.<note place="margin">Exod. 10.27.</note> 
                  <hi>I have hardned his heart,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.13. And how is this done? How can God be ſaid to harden a ſinners heart?<note place="margin">Non infun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendo mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſubtrahendo gratiam.</note> not by infuſing any evil qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities that were not there before, but by withdrawing the ſtriving of his Spirit, and leaving a man to be acted by his own luſts, which do quickly work to <hi>hardening the heart;</hi> and therefore that which is called <hi>a hardening the heart</hi> there, is by the Apoſtle here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by <hi>giving up to uncleanneſs, to vile affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, to a reprobate mind.</hi> Which imports no more but a dereliction of the Spirit, a ceaſing to ſtrive any longer.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, If a man may poſſibly commit the unpardonable ſin, the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, then he may out-live the ſtrivings of the Spirit, and ſin away his day of grace. But this is poſſible for a man to do; ſo did thoſe Phariſees and Scribes,<note place="margin">Mat. 9.34.</note> 
                  <hi>Mark</hi> 3. They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this ſin, <hi>v.</hi> 22. And the Lord Chriſt charges them with it, and tells them they ſhall never be pardoned nor ſaved by reaſon
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:63179:81"/>
of it, <hi>v.</hi> 29, 30. So that they out-lived their day of grace. Therefore the thing is moſt evident, that a man may ſo long go on in ſin, and ſo, far reſiſt the Spirit, in his ſtrivings with the Soul, as that his day of grace may be paſt and gone. It may be ſinned away.</p>
               <p>How long the Spirit of the Lord may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to ſtrive with a ſinner before he gives over and ſtrives no more, that I think is a queſtion too hard for any man to determine; to ſay thus long the Spirit will ſtrive, but no longer; thus long the ſinners day of grace ſhall continue, but no longer, is beyond the skill of any man.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe things that are purely arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry come under no rule.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Scripture is ſilent as to any poſitive determination herein; God hath no where ſaid how long it ſhall be; how long he will wait to be gracious. And where the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture doth not determine, who can? We ought not to have an ear to hear, where the Scripture hath not a tongue to ſpeak.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is moſt certain that the day of grace hath differing periods. It is not of the ſame length to all, one ſinner hath the glaſs of his opportunity ſooner run out than another. To ſome God calls, and ſets open the door of grace for them, and if they will enter, well and good; if not, he ſhuts the door upon them and never opens it more. To others he ſhews <hi>much long ſuffering,</hi> he calls aloud,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.22.</note> and ſtrives much, and knocks often at the ſinners door before he will take a denial. To
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:63179:82"/>
ſome God <hi>lays the ax to the root of the tree,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 3.10.</note> and ſays either <hi>bear</hi> or <hi>burn,</hi> either for <hi>fruit</hi> or <hi>fire.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 13.6, 7.</note> To others God comes <hi>looking for fruit</hi> one year after another before he gives the word for the cutting them down.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The patience of God doth not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the thing. For that may be continued to a ſinner when the Spirit hath given him over, and done ſtriving with him; there may be a long day of forbearance where the day of grace is paſt. The Lord awaken ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to conſider this, for they are very apt to preſume upon Gods <hi>patience,</hi> and think that a <hi>ſeaſon of repentance;</hi> whereas the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and converſion of the ſinner doth not depend ſo much upon <hi>Gods patience</hi> as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Spirits ſtrivings.</hi> It is this that puts a <hi>price into our hands to get wiſdom,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 17.16.</note> this makes the ſeaſon of grace; the <hi>patience</hi> of God may be for a contrary end, it may be only for the <hi>filling up the meaſure of our iniquity.</hi> And therefore ſinners may poſſibly live long under Gods <hi>patience and forbearance,</hi> and yet the ſeaſon of the <hi>Spirits ſtrivings</hi> may be at an end. But yet though none can ſay how long or how little while the ſinners day of grace ſhall laſt, yet theſe two things may be ſafely ſaid concerning it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The greater the means of grace is, the ſhorter the day of grace is, the old world had not ſo great means, but then they had a longer day: <hi>My Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive with man—yet his days ſhall be an hundred and twenty years,</hi> Gen. 6.3. It is not meant
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:63179:82"/>
of the days of his life, that he ſhould live ſo long; but it is meant of the day of grace; ſo many years God would give them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in; ſo many years his Spirit ſhould ſtrive with them before judgment was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</p>
               <p>The people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had greater means than the old World, but then their day of grace was ſhorter: <hi>Forty years ſuffered he their manners in the wilderneſs,</hi> Acts 13.18.</p>
               <p>And afterwards in <hi>Canaan</hi> ſtill as their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges were inlarged, ſo their day was ſhortned. Never were their injoyments ſo great as by the coming of Chriſt in the fleſh, but yet this ſhortned their day of grace the more; as you may ſee in that Parable of the Fig-tree, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.6, 7. And in that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion which Chriſt gives to his Diſciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.10, 11. <hi>Into whatever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go out into the ſtreet and ſay, Even the very duſt of your city we do wipe off against you, notwithſtanding be ye ſure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh to you.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Tell them this is their day of grace, which ſince they ſlight, God will ſhake off them as you do the duſt of your feet.</p>
               <p>The more lively and awakening the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry you at any time ſit under is, the ſhorter your day of grace is; for it either converts or hardens; it either betters your eſtate, or makes it worſe. If it be not <hi>a ſavour of life to life,</hi> it will be <hi>a ſavour of death unto death,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. It never leaves ſinners as it
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:63179:83"/>
finds them. If your ſpiritual eſtate be not bettered by it, the Spirit of the Lord will not ſtrive long, and then your converſion is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. There are three ſad evils which the Goſpel brings upon impenitent ſinners.</p>
               <p>Their Judge will be ſeverer.</p>
               <p>Their Hell will be hotter.</p>
               <p>Their Seaſon of Grace and time of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſtriving will be ſhorter. For <hi>he will finiſh the work, and cut it ſhort in righteouſneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a ſhort work will the Lord make upon the earth,</hi> Rom. 9.28.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The more profligate and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in ſinning men grow under the Goſpel, the ſooner will the Spirit ceaſe ſtriving. For a man may (and many a man doth) by his own ſin ſhorten his day of grace, and provoke God to ſtrive by his Spirit no more; <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> ſpeaking of the ſinners of the old World, ſays <hi>They were cut down out of time, and their foundation overflowed with a flood,</hi> Job 22.16. And therefore what ſhall we think of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s Priviledges? Will they laſt long? I am afraid they will not, conſidering the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate wickedneſs of the Nation that reigns in all ſorts, this may juſtly cauſe God to <hi>cut them down out of time,</hi> and cauſe <hi>a flood</hi> of judgments to <hi>overflow their foundations.</hi> The abominable pride, gluttony, drunkenneſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, ſwearing, lying, Covenant break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, oppreſſion, injuſtice, perjuries, together with the Errours, Hereſies, Schiſms, Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Idolatries, and Atheiſm of the day; and I will add, the unrighteous perſecution
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:63179:83"/>
of the Miniſters and Members of Chriſt for nothing but their adhering to the word and Kingly Office of Chriſt: theſe things, I fear, have brought the Nations day and mercies to a near period. And though I ſpeak it with trembling, yet I muſt ſay it, That without a ſpeedy repentance the Lord will ſhortly do one of theſe two things, either he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move this generation from the Goſpel, or elſe he will remove the Goſpel from this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee where the force of this reaſon lies, delay of ſo great a Duty is greatly dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, whether you look to the indiſpoſition it works, or to the uncertainty of life, or to the uncertain duration of the day of grace, which may be ſinned away; and then if you would come to Chriſt, you cannot: <hi>Then ſhall they call upon me, but I will not anſwer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 1.28, 29, 30.</note> 
                  <hi>they ſhall ſeek me early, but they ſhall not find me; for that they hated knowledge, and did not chuſe the fear of the Lord: They would none of my counſel, they despiſed all my reproof.</hi> Salvation is not a thing to be had at your time, but at Gods time; and Gods time is now in your youth. Moſt agree that it is a reaſonable thing that ſin ſhould be forſaken, that the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt ſhould be taken up; but not ſo ſoon, it is too early; and this is it upon which moſt men periſh; they ſlight Gods time: <hi>When I would have healed Iſrael, then the iniquity of Ephraim was diſcovered,</hi> Hoſ. 7.1. A man never diſcovers more iniquity, and more love to ſin, than in ſetting light by Gods time
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:63179:84"/>
of healing. The <hi>fooliſh Virgins</hi> would fain have entred in with the Bridegroom, but when they <hi>ſhould</hi> have entred, their oyl was to get; and when they <hi>would</hi> have entred, the door was ſhut, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.10. Ye read in <hi>Revel.</hi> 10.1, 2, 6. of <hi>an Angel</hi> that <hi>hath in his hand a little book open,</hi> and he <hi>ſwears by him that lives for ever and ever that time ſhould be no longer.</hi> This <hi>Angel</hi> is interpreted of Chriſt, and the <hi>little book in his hand</hi> is the Goſpel, and it is ſaid to be <hi>open,</hi> becauſe he makes known the whole counſel of God for our Salvation; it is Chriſt that gives out the Goſpel and means of grace; and it is he that limits the time of mans injoying it, beyond which he cannot injoy it, for he ſweareth that <hi>time ſhall be no longer.</hi>

                     <hi>Manton</hi> on Pſal. 119. <hi>p.</hi> 456.</note> As the promiſes of pardon and eternal life ſuit with the hunger and thirſt of the Soul and the natural deſires of happineſs; ſo the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and righteouſneſs of the precept ſuit with the notions of good and evil that are in mans heart, and this draws forth compliance and conſent. <hi>I conſent to the Law that it is good,</hi> Rom. 7.16. <hi>It is good for me to draw near to God,</hi> Pſal. 73.28. There is no like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier means to prevail upon conſidering minds to come under the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt betimes, than to let them ſee how much duty is their real intereſt, and that obedience is not bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſo much as bleſſedneſs, for that there is an univerſal good in Religion.</p>
               <p>It is a <hi>neceſſary good,</hi> a <hi>profitable</hi> good, an <hi>honourable</hi> good, a <hi>pleaſant</hi> good.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is a <hi>neceſſary good.</hi> Nothing in the world is of equal neceſſity with this; there are many things <hi>uſeful,</hi> but this is that one thing <hi>needful.</hi> So our Lord Chriſt ſays, <hi>One thing is needful,</hi> Luke 10.42. and that is ſubjection to Chriſt. <hi>Martha</hi> was careful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his entertainment, but <hi>Mary</hi> ſate at his feet; one was providing for her <hi>Saviour,</hi> the other for her <hi>Soul;</hi> and this was the moſt needful work. <hi>Martha</hi> was cumber'd with much ſerving, and this diſtracted her in her obedience, which was the one thing needful. It is more neceſſary to obey Chriſt than thus to ſerve him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> It it neceſſary by a <hi>neceſſity of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept;</hi> that which is firſt preſſed ſhould be moſt
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:63179:85"/>
chiefly endeavoured, and that is the buſineſs of Religion: <hi>Firſt ſeek ye the kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs,</hi> Mat. 6.33. <hi>Firſt,</hi> before any thing elſe; and <hi>first,</hi> more than any thing elſe. The Lord Chriſt here takes their hearts off from worldly cares by ſetting them upon a more neceſſary duty; for as <hi>the body is more than raiment,</hi> Mat. 6.25. ſo is the Soul more than the body; hence that of our Lord, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.27. <hi>Labour not for the meat that periſheth, but for that meat which endureth to everlaſting life.</hi> God is a ſupreme Lord, to whom we all owe obedience, and this puts a <hi>muſt</hi> upon us as to duty; ſo it did upon Chriſt himſelf, <hi>I muſt work the works of him that ſent me,</hi> Joh. 9.4. This laid that neceſſity upon the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.16. <hi>Neceſſity is laid me.</hi> It is neceſſary God ſhould be obeyed whatever his precepts are; his charge muſt be kept, and his will fulfilled, for he is <hi>Lord of all;</hi> he is not only a Saviour but a Law-giver, and therefore obedience is as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as truſt and dependance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is neceſſary by a neceſſity of means. He that would arrive at a deſigned end, muſt purſue it by due and proper means. Eternal life and ſalvation is the end which the great God propounds to all, he <hi>would have all men to be ſaved,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.4. But how? by an abſolute Decree? No, though many argue thus blindly: If God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed me to Salvation I ſhall be ſaved, let me live how I liſt. God never made any ſuch Decree: he hath as much decreed the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:63179:86"/>
means as the end; converſion and ſubjection to Chriſt are as much decreed as Salvation and eternal life. So that no man can be ſaved in an unregenerate ſtate; what can be more poſitive and plain than that of our Lord Chriſt: <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the kingdom of God.</hi> He doth not ſay, he is not like to ſee the Kingdom of God, or he ſhall not ſee the Kingdom of God, but he <hi>cannot</hi> ſee the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. The Salvation of that man that cleaves to his luſts, and refuſes obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Jeſus Chriſt, is morally impoſſible; he muſt periſh, and that upon a twofold ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A <hi>natural</hi> neceſſity. For it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the holy God and unholy Sinners can dwell together. Did God burn up <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha?</hi> drown the old World? caſt <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> out of Paradiſe? and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels out of Heaven for their ſins? and will he lay thee in his boſom in thy enmity and filth? Darkneſs and light may as ſoon incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate, and contraries ſubſiſt together, nay God may as ſoon change his nature, and ceaſe to be what he is, as ſave a man in his ſins and diſobedience. It is contrary to his Holineſs;<note place="margin">Pſal. 101.7.</note> if holy <hi>David</hi> would not ſuffer wicked perſons to dwell in his houſe, can we think the holy God will ever ſuffer them to dwell in Heaven?</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a <hi>legal</hi> neceſſity that he that continues in his luſts and unregeneracy muſt periſh, and that becauſe of the Will and Law
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:63179:86"/>
of God. As God wills the Salvation of all that will turn to God and obey him; ſo he wills the damnation of all that will not, but hold faſt their luſts and refuſe to return. As he hath made a Law that whoever will come to Chriſt, and take up his <hi>Yoke,</hi> ſhall find reſt to his Soul, and ſhall live for ever; ſo he hath declared it as peremptorily, that he that ſlights Chriſt, and will not hearken to him and obey him, ſhall be utterly cut off; he ſhall periſh in his enmity; it ſhall be worſe with him than with <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha;</hi> he ſhall periſh under the foreſt of puniſhments, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. And therefore there is as great a neceſſity that ſuch ſhould periſh, as there is that God ſhould be true to his word; for it is gone out of his mouth in righteouſneſs and cannot return. If God ſays,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.9.</note> 
                  <hi>No unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous thing ſhall inherit the kingdom of God,</hi> why then the wicked muſt be ſhut out. If God ſays, <hi>He that believes not ſhall be damned,</hi> Mar. 16.16. then damnation muſt be the portion of Unbelievers. If God ſays, Chriſt ſhall come <hi>in flaming fire taking vengeance on all that know not God, and that obey not the Gospel of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1.8. then the diſobedient muſt be the objects of his eternal vengeance. If Chriſt ſays, <hi>He that denies me before men, I will deny him before my Father which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> Mat. 10.33. then it is impoſſible that he who doth not obey his commands, ſhould have any benefit by his Interceſſion. For God will never repeal any of thoſe righteous Laws he hath made concerning good and evil,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:63179:87"/>
Saints and Sinners, Heaven and Hell, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Damnation. And if ſo, <hi>what will be the end of them that obey not the Goſpel?</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17. What will become of thoſe rebels that hold a <hi>counſel together againſt the Lord and his Chriſt,</hi> that they may <hi>break their bands-aſunder, and caſt their cords from them?</hi> Pſal. 2.2, 3.</p>
               <p>There is therefore the ſame neceſſity of Holineſs as there is of Salvation. Many think they may be ſaved without it; live as they liſt, and yet injoy God at laſt. But what ſays the Scripture? <hi>Without holineſs no man ſhall ever ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12.14. There is the ſame neceſſity of taking upon you the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt, as there is of injoying the preſence of Chriſt. Is the eternal happineſs of the Soul neceſſary? then ſo muſt the bearing Chriſts <hi>Yoke</hi> be, for this is the means to the end; <hi>non pervenitur ad finem niſi per media.</hi> It doth not merit Heaven, but it is the way to Heaven. It is that which qualifies for glory. Heaven is the purchaſe of Chriſts Blood, (<hi>a purchaſed poſſeſſion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 9.12.</note> Eph. 1.14.) but how can you hope for the benefit of his Blood, if you do not ſtoop to his <hi>Yoke? He is the Author of eternal ſalvation to them that obey him,</hi> Heb. 5.9. Slight Chriſt, and you ruine your Souls. <hi>We will not have this man to reign over us,</hi> Luk. 19.14. And what is the fruit of it? Chriſt will take you for the enemies of his Kingdom and Government, and will deal with you as ſuch. <hi>Thoſe mine enemies which would not that I ſhould reign over them, bring hither, and ſlay them before me,</hi> v. 27.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:63179:87"/>O Sirs! do ye know what ye do when ye deſpiſe and reject the Laws and Soveraignty of Chriſt? You deſpiſe his Mercy; ye dare his Juſtice; you ſlight his Love; ye trample his Blood under foot; ye render mercy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent; (<hi>He could do no mighty work,</hi> Mark 6.5.) you make the <hi>Lamb</hi> turn <hi>Lion;</hi> you lay your ſelves under a neceſſity of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for all wilful refuſers of Chriſt muſt periſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is neceſſary to preſerve the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitude of Nature; if a man would be under the government of mind and underſtanding, and keep reaſon in the Throne, and be able to ſubdue the inordinacy of appetite, he muſt come under the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt, nothing elſe can do it; <hi>Philoſophy</hi> may give rules, but it is <hi>Religion</hi> that gives power. How like a brute is man that is led by ſenſe, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by appetite; the glory of his Being is loſt. A beaſt in the ſhape and figure of a reaſonable Creature; man without, but brute within. There is no middle thing; every man is either a Saint or a Beaſt. If he don't conform to Chriſt, which is the trueſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of mind and will, he is under the government of ſenſe, and ſwayed by appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite; and what makes a man more a beaſt than this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is neceſſary to prove your right to, and intereſt in Chriſt. The pretence and claim to this is very common, but right and intereſt is very rare; therefore it is good to put things out of doubt: <hi>Let every man prove
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:63179:88"/>
his own work,</hi> Gal. 6.4. <hi>Know ye not that Chriſt is in you, except ye be reprobates?</hi> 2 Cor. 13.5. How may this be known? why the Apoſtle tells you, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>Whoſo keepeth his word in him is the love of God perfected; hereby know we that we are in him.</hi> Your obedience is the beſt teſt of your intereſt; nothing proves your relation to his Perſon like your ſubjection to his Precepts. <hi>Hereby we know that we are of the truth, and ſhall aſſure our hearts before him,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19. Many boaſt great things about their intereſt in Chriſt, and have great joys and tranſports flowing from it; and yet all may be but the birth of a dream, the fruit of fancy and fond opinion, and it is no other where ſubjection to Chriſt is left out. <hi>He that ſaith, I know him, and keeps not his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.4. That is a ſharp rebuke of Chriſt to thoſe falſe Diſciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.46. <hi>Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I ſay?</hi> Chriſt hates their pretences of relation to him, while they ſlight his Precepts, and diſown his Government.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It is neceſſary to ſhew our grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to a Redeemer, which can no way be expreſſed as it ought, but by a dutiful ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to his precepts. <hi>Let us not love in word and in tongue,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>but in deed and in truth,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.18. We never expreſs our thankful ſenſe of redeeming love to the life, till we make his Laws the rule of our
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:63179:88"/>
life. And thus doth <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 116.8, 9. <hi>Thou haſt delivered my ſoul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling. I will walk before the Lord in the land of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</hi> The greateſt love that ever God ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was to give Jeſus Chriſt. And the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt grace that ever Chriſt manifeſted was the grace of Redemption, when <hi>he gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, Tit.</hi> 2.14. And the higheſt obedience the Creature can act, is when it ſprings from a grateful ſenſe of the Fathers love in giving Chriſt, and of Chriſts grace in giving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. When we lay the foundation of our obedience where God hath laid it, in the Blood of his Son; when we love God from a ſenſe of his love to us in Chriſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.19. When mercy melts and wins us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. When <hi>the grace of God</hi> appearing <hi>teacheth us to deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tit. 2.11 12.</note> and <hi>to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in the world,</hi> this is excellent.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle ſays, That <hi>faith worketh by love,</hi> Gal. 5.6. And it doth ſo two ways; by way of gratitude, and by way of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality. It firſt apprehendeth love, and leaves the impreſſion of it upon the Soul, and ſo begets ſuch a love in the Soul to God as works a dutiful ſubjection to all his Precepts: <hi>This is the love of God, that we keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and his commandments are not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.3.</p>
               <p>The end of Redemption is duty; Chriſt had no deſign to diminiſh the Soveraignty of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:63179:89"/>
God, or leſſen mans duty in any of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings; but to make us more capable of ſervice, and to render duty more eaſie. There is mercy provided for our failings, but no relaxation of obedience; the Goſpel requires as perfect holineſs as ever the Law did, yet we have a double relief provided; by <hi>ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> on our part, and <hi>mercy</hi> on God's. Though there be no <hi>indulgence</hi> by Chriſt: to the <hi>least</hi> ſin, yet there is <hi>pardon</hi> provided for the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt.</hi> Chriſt came not to be <hi>a miniſter of ſin,</hi> to deliver us from obedience; but he came to deliver us from the ſlavery of obedience; not that we might not ſerve God, but that <hi>we might ſerve him without fear,</hi> Luk. 1.74. that is, with peace of Conſcience, and joy of heart.</p>
               <p>And therefore great is the gratitude we owe to Chriſt; and it can no way be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but by a voluntary reſignation to his will, and ſubjection to his <hi>Yoke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> It is neceſſary for the confirming our Faith in the promiſes of God. There is an inſeparable connexion between the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Promiſes; the one is as eſſential a part of the Covenant of Grace, as the other; there is, <hi>you ſhall,</hi> as well as <hi>I will. I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a people,</hi> Heb. 8.10. <hi>I will put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes, and ye ſhall keep my judgments and do them,</hi> Ezek. 36.27. There is obedience injoyned, as well as mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy promiſed. The Covenant is of Gods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving, not ours; he preſcribes the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:63179:89"/>
and propounds the rewards, not we. Our work is intire ſubmiſſion and hearty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, we are neither to alter nor debate. And in this Covenant our eternal happineſs is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by an unfeigned conſent of will to take Chriſt; upon the conditions God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; and what are they? Chriſt and his <hi>Yoke;</hi> that is, Chriſt to rule as well as to ſave, for he came not only to be a Saviour, but a Law-giver: <hi>The Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our Law-giver, the Lord is our King, he will ſave us,</hi> Iſai. 33.22. As <hi>Law-giver,</hi> he preſcribes the rule of obedience; as <hi>King,</hi> he rules by the Law he preſcribes; as <hi>Judge,</hi> he will try us by the Law of his Government, and ſave thoſe that have <hi>ſought his precepts;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.94.</note> and therefore our faith in the promiſe of eternal rewards muſt be ſupported by our faithfulneſs to the commands; the greater our obedience, the higher is our hope of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance: <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.7, 8.</note> there is his obedience; <hi>henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteouſneſs,</hi> there is his confidence.</p>
               <p>Remiſneſs in obedience makes a waſte up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Faith; let duty be omitted, or luſt indulged, and Faith languiſhes; and needs it muſt, for ſin in the converſation breeds doubts in the condition; and it is as natural to do ſo, as it is for a wound to cauſe pain. Could a man obey without ſwerving, he might believe without doubting; the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt holineſs is uſually attended with the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:63179:90"/>
ſweeteſt peace and the higheſt aſſurance: <hi>Iſai.</hi> 32.17. <hi>The work of righteouſneſs ſhall be peace, and the effect of righteouſneſs quietneſs and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for ever.</hi> And therefore when any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſtrong hope in God, and talk of their comfort in the Promiſes, and great aſſurance; and yet are careleſs and remiſs in their walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God, and ſlack in their obedience; thoſe pretences are much to be ſuſpected, and the ſtate of that man to be queſtioned. For ſin doth as naturally breed <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>diſtrust,</hi> as obedience doth <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>peace.</hi> How can a man hope in God, when he doth not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him? or expect mercy, when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes him to wrath by neglect of duty? Therefore Satan doth two works at once when he tempts us to the practice of ſin; he <hi>ſtains</hi> our Souls, and he <hi>weakens</hi> our truſt. He makes us <hi>fail</hi> in duty, and <hi>doubt</hi> of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for ſin leaves a guilt, and guilt cauſes fear; and the more our fear the leſs our faith; as the one ſtrengthens, the other weakens; they are like the two Buckets of a Well, as one goes up, the other goes down. That ſin that leſſens our reſpect to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, will proportionably weaken our faith in the Promiſe; a man can never be much in dependance that is little in obedience: Therefore duty is neceſſary for the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our truſt in God; the Soul never attains to true reſt but by taking up Chriſts <hi>Yoke, Mat.</hi> 11.29.</p>
               <p>That is one branch of the reaſon why it is the concernment of every one to take up the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:63179:90"/>
                  <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt in his youth, becauſe it is good. It is a neceſſary good, I have ſhewed you in ſix particulars the neceſſity of it.</p>
               <p>It is neceſſary by virtue of the Precept.</p>
               <p>Neceſſary as a means to the great End.</p>
               <p>Neceſſary to preſerve the rectitude of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Neceſſary to adjuſt our intereſt in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Neceſſary to manifeſt our gratitude to a Redeemer.</p>
               <p>Neceſſary for the ſtabliſhing our Faith in the Promiſes of God.</p>
               <p>Now that which is a good of ſo great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity ought to be our greateſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; we ſhould mind it more than what is not ſo; there are many things that are not neceſſary; it is not neceſſary we ſhould be rich, or great in the world; or that we ſhould be gay and gawdy in our dreſſes; or that we ſhould have the cap and knee of by-ſtanders; or that we ſhould wallow in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and delights; it will not be a pin to chuſe e're long what part we have acted here; when the Scepter and the Spade ſhall have one common grave, and Royal duſt ſhall be blended with the beggars aſhes: but it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary we ſhould be born again; it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary we ſhould be acquainted with God, and make him our portion; it is neceſſary we ſhould ſubmit to the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt, and owne his commands, and live to the Lord; there is nothing neceſſary but this. Therefore we ought to make it our buſineſs, to come under this <hi>Yoke</hi> betimes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:63179:91"/>Secondly, Subjection to the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt is a <hi>profitable good.</hi> And there is no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of greater prevalency than that which is taken <hi>ab utili.</hi> A man will do any thing that he is convinced is for his benefit; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God quickens us to a holy life by the conſideration of our own benefit.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.6.</note> 
                  <hi>Godlineſs is great gain.</hi> Though God, by virtue of his Soveraignty over us, might have impoſed what commands he pleaſed without the leaſt injuſtice; yet ſo gracious he is, that he hath not acted by Soveraignty, but with a reſpect to our advantage. Not one command of God but the intereſt of the Creature is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promoted by it. The moſt thrifty courſe a man can take in this world is to come under the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt betimes: <hi>Happy is the man that findeth wiſdom, and the man that getteth underſtanding; for the merchandiſe of it is better than the merchandiſe of ſilver, and the gain thereof than fine gold; ſhe is more precious than rubies; and all the things thou canſt deſire are not to be compared to her. Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> Prov. 3.13, 14, 15, 16.</p>
               <p>Religion is looked on by many with an evil eye upon this very account, as ſtanding in the way of their profit; and as being an enemy to their particular advantages: <hi>What profit ſhall we have if we pray to the Almighty? Job</hi> 21.15. Moſt men follow Chriſt for the Loaves;<note place="margin">Joh. 6.26.</note> 
                  <hi>no penny no Pater noſter;</hi> no profit no prayer. <hi>Ye have ſaid it is in vain to ſerve God, and what profit is it that we have kept his
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:63179:91"/>
ordinances?</hi> Mal. 3.14. They look upon the ſervice of Chriſt as a very poor trade, and thriftleſs imployment; whereas it is a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the greateſt benefit. Nothing tends ſo much to our advantage as a life of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and obedience.</p>
               <p>As for inſtance:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Is that profitable which ſanctifieth eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry condition to a man? This Religion doth. <hi>To the pure all things are pure,</hi> Tit. 1.15. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſanctifies the heart and affections, and all things are ſanctified to a ſanctified heart.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Is that profitable which is beneficial to a man in all his circumſtances? So is Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>If a man abound with the good things of the preſent life, Religion is of admirable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to direct the uſes and injoyment, to guard the heart from its ſnares by keeping the mind humble under it, and ſetting the affections above it.<note place="margin">Phil. 4.12.</note> It teaches how to be full and abound, how to do good, how to make friends of <hi>Mammon.</hi> It makes outward proſperity to forward and promote our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal intereſt by applying it to ſerve the honour of God, and others neceſſities as well as our own.</p>
               <p>If a man be poor; Religion is no leſs uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to befriend a man in this caſe, by teaching contentment with a little;<note place="margin">Phil. 4.11.</note> by working the heart to a full reſignedneſs to the will of God;<note place="margin">Phil. 4.12.</note> by teaching how to want and ſuffer need; by ſetting the heart upon things of a nobler nature, and more neceſſary concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:63179:92"/>
upon God and heavenly things; by fixing the Souls dependance upon thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made to godlineſs which do as ſurely intitle a man to preſent ſufficiencies,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.8.</note> as to eternal rewards. So that when the needy ſinner carks and cares, murmurs and repines, robs and deceives for a ſupply of his wants, the good man having a ſure intereſt in God, reſts confidently upon the never failing ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of an ingaged Providence.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Is that profitable which brings its own reward with it? This Religion doth. <hi>In keeping thy commandments there is great reward, Pſal.</hi> 19.11. The Prophet ſeems here not to intend the future recompence of reward which the obedient ſhall receive at laſt in Heaven; for that is a reward <hi>for keeping</hi> his commandments, (though it is a reward not of <hi>merit</hi> but of <hi>grace</hi>) but this is a reward <hi>in keeping</hi> his commandments. The full har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt will be hereafter, but yet the Chriſtian hath a preſent reaping time; for God <hi>meets them that rejoyce and work righteouſneſs, that remember him in his ways,</hi> Iſai. 64.5. Our Lord Chriſt tells <hi>Peter</hi> (Mark 10.30, 31.) That whoever hath <hi>left houſe, or relations, or lands for his ſake and the Goſpel's, ſhall receive an hundred fold now in this life.</hi> So that there is a reward <hi>in</hi> obedience as well as <hi>for</hi> it. As beaten Spices recompenſe the pains by their grateful ſmell, ſo the practice of Religion cauſes a ſweet reflection upon the Soul, and is thereby its own recompence. Therefore <hi>David</hi> elſewhere ſpeaks of what he <hi>had,</hi> as a
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:63179:92"/>
reward of obedience, as well as what he <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for.</hi> Pſal. 119.56. <hi>This I had, becauſe I kept thy precepts. This I had,</hi> but he doth not tell you what; but that may eaſily be gueſſed at by the dealings of God with him: He had peace of Conſcience; he had the quicknings of God; he had increaſe of grace; he had frequent communion with God; he had joy in the Holy Ghoſt; he had many great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences, many deliverances and ſalvations; and all this was the fruit of his obedience. <hi>This I had becauſe I kept thy precepts,</hi> to be ſure it was ſome great Boon, becauſe he mentions it ſo gratefully as a reward of mercy for his cloſe walking with God. So that the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Chriſtian hath not all in hope, there is much in hand; he poſſeſſes much, though he expects more. For <hi>godlineſs hath</hi> both <hi>the promiſe of this life, and of that which is to come.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.8.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Is that profitable which fills the Soul with ſuch joy as nothing elſe can? This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion doth. It reconciles the Soul to God, ſtamps it with his image, lays it in with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine principles, whereby he is inabled to take the teſtimonies of God <hi>for his heritage for ever, which become the rejoycing of his heart, Pſal.</hi> 119.111. The Promiſes believed do not only create a joy in the Soul; <hi>filled with peace and joy in believing,</hi> Rom. 15.13. but the Precepts obeyed miniſter joy alſo: <hi>The ſtatutes of the Lord are right, rejoycing the heart, Pſal.</hi> 19.8. So that the good mans joy ariſes from a double ſpring; Faith ſecures his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the promiſe, and ſo he <hi>rejoyces in
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:63179:93"/>
hope of the glory of God,</hi> Rom. 5.2. Holineſs ſubjects him to the precept, and ſo he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyces in his conformity to the will of God. <hi>I rejoyced in the way of thy teſtimonies more than in all riches,</hi> Pſal. 119.14. This is a joy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to the Children of God; none partake of this <hi>oyl of gladneſs,</hi> but they who have the oyl of grace in their veſſels. Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient ſinners are ſtrangers to this joy, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.10. Theirs is a joy ariſing either out of periſhing comforts, the joy of <hi>corn and wine and oyl,</hi> Pſal. 4.7. or which is worſe, out of ſinful acts and objects: <hi>Who rejoyce to do evil, Prov.</hi> 2.14. Now this is a poor, weak, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful joy; it wets the mouth, but cannot warm the heart: <hi>In the midst of laughter the heart is ſorrowful,</hi> Prov. 14.13. It is rather revelling than rejoycing, and therefore the Wiſe-man calls it mad mirth: <hi>I have ſaid of laughter it is mad, and of mirth what doth it? Eccleſ.</hi> 2.2. What ſatisfaction doth it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford? what profit doth it bring with it? Will it eaſe the ſmart of affliction? will it remove the fears and doubts of Conſcience? will it bear us up againſt reproaches? will it help us againſt the fear of death and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? If not, then <hi>what doth it?</hi> it emaſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the ſpirits, diſcompoſes the judgment, diſplaces reaſon, feeds the ſenſes, and ſtarves the Soul: and <hi>the end of that mirth is heavineſs,</hi> Prov. 14.13.</p>
               <p>So that carnal joy is but a <hi>cold armful,</hi> as one ſaith of a bad wife<note n="*" place="margin">

                     </gap>. Apud Sophocl. in Antig.</note>. Like <hi>Adonijah</hi>'s feaſt (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 1.9, 49.) that began in mirth,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:63179:93"/>
but ended in fear;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 13.26, 82.</note> or like <hi>Amnon</hi>'s entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Abſolom</hi>'s ſheep-ſhearing, who met with death at the banquet. <hi>Solomon</hi> compares it to the <hi>crackling of thorns under a pot,</hi> Eccleſ. 7.6. where there is much noiſe, but little fire; much light, but little heat, and ſoon extinct. As Comets make a great blaze, but when their exhaled matter is ſpent, they end in a peſtilent vapor. Such is the ſinners joy, ſoon lighted and ſoon waſted; when his can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle is put out (as it quickly will be) it leaves a ſtink behind. <hi>Wo to you that laugh now, for ye ſhall mourn,</hi> Luke 6.25. The ſinner purchaſes his joy with guilt and ſhame, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes it with an accuſing vexing Conſcience, and at laſt it is extinguiſhed, if not in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent terrors, yet to be ſure in eternal tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>But the joy of obedience and holy walking is another thing; it is a ſpiritual and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joy, wrought by a ſpiritual power, drawn out by ſpiritual arguments, fixed upon a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual object, and ſerves to ſpiritual ends and uſes, to give check to worldly luſts, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh ſenſual appetite, and abate the reliſh of carnal pleaſures, to ſupport under loſſes, wants, reproaches; to fence againſt the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of Conſcience, to arm us againſt the fear of death and damnation. In all theſe things <hi>the joy of the Lord is</hi> the good mans <hi>ſtrength, Nehem.</hi> 8.10. and therefore it is called <hi>ſtrong conſolation,</hi> Heb. 6.18. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing conſolation. It is prevalent againſt all oppoſition, both from corruption within,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:63179:94"/>
and temptation without. It gives relief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all fears, doubts, and troubles; either it prevents them, or prevents the miſchief of them, by ſupporting the Soul under them. This is ſuch a good, that as no good can <hi>match</hi> it, ſo no evil can <hi>over-match</hi> it. A heart full of grace, and a conſcience full of comfort, makes a man ſit either for doing or ſuffering; it makes him inſuperable under durances, and unſatisfiable in duties; for that hereby every croſs becomes tolerable and light, and every command delectable and ſweet.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Is that profitable that at once ſerves our <hi>temporal,</hi> our <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> and our <hi>eternal</hi> intereſt and advantage? This Religion doth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It ſerves our <hi>temporal</hi> intereſt. <hi>Seek ye firſt the kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs, and all theſe things ſhall be added to you,</hi> Mat. 6.33. In the Chriſtians Charter the <hi>World</hi> is put in as well as <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>things preſent,</hi> as well as <hi>things to come,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.21, 22. It is ſaid of Wiſdom (that is Chriſt) <hi>Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and honour,</hi> Prov. 3.16. And what doth Chriſt do with theſe bleſſings in his hand, but beſtow them upon thoſe that keep his precepts with their whole heart? And therefore the ſame thing is ſaid of obedience, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2. <hi>Let thine heart keep my commandments, for length of days, and long life, and peace</hi> (which comprehends all the reſt) <hi>ſhall they add unto thee.</hi> Pray mind, they are in the hand of Chriſt, (for <hi>the Father hath put all things into his hand</hi>) and yet they are handed-out
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:63179:94"/>
by the Commandments. How is that? why thus: Obedience to the commands qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifies us to receive the bleſſings of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and then Chriſt hands out to us the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed bleſſings. Unleſs theſe things were in the hand of Chriſt, obedience would never add them to us; and unleſs we are found in the way of obedience, Chriſt will never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow them upon us; for we have no claim. It is <hi>Godlineſs</hi> that <hi>hath the promiſe of this life;</hi> and ſo it ſerves our temporal intereſt. Though the temporal rewards of godlineſs muſt be expected with much ſubmiſſion; yet, ſo far as they are good for us, they are as much ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to us as Heaven and Glory. <hi>He will give grace and glory, and no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly,</hi> Pſal. 84.11.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Godlineſs ſerves our <hi>ſpiritual</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and that is the thing we are chiefly to mind; the Soul is far more than the body, and therefore a <hi>spiritual</hi> good is to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before a <hi>corporal.</hi> Religion ſerves our ſpiritual intereſt two ways.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It ſecures to us the chief good; that good that is comprehenſively all good, and without which nothing can be good, and that is God. God with all his Attributes, God with all his Treaſures, God with all his Promiſes; if we perform our part of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, God will not fail of his part: <hi>Ye ſhall keep my judgments and do them.</hi> And what then? <hi>ye ſhall be my people, and I will be your God,</hi> Ezek. 36.27, 28.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:63179:95"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It ſecures the life of the Soul. And that is more worth than all the world. This Chriſt intimates in that queſtion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.26. <hi>What is a man profited, if he ſhall gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul? Or what ſhall a man give in exchange for his ſoul?</hi> Two things are here intimated.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If a man ſhould gain the whole world with the loſs of his Soul, it would be but a loſing bargain.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the Soul is once loſt, nothing in the world can regain or redeem it. And therefore what ſo profitable as Religion, that ſecures the life of the Soul? All the gold in the world can't ſecure the Soul, but grace can. <hi>Riches profit not in the day of wrath, but righteouſneſs delivers from death,</hi> Prov. 11.4. <hi>In the way of righteouſneſs is life, and in the path<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way thereof there is no death,</hi> Prov. 12.28.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Godlineſs ſerves our <hi>eternal</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. It tends to an everlaſting bleſſedneſs. And herein the greateſt gain of godlineſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, in that it <hi>hath the promiſe of the life that is to come,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.8. The Soul is immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and therefore cannot be ſatisfied with any periſhing good; man that lives for ever muſt have a happineſs that will endure for ever; and there is but one way to ſecure it, and that is by an obedient ſubjection to the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt. This is the appointed means to that bleſſed end. <hi>Being made free from ſin, and become ſervants to God, ye have your fruit unto holineſs, and the end everlaſting life,</hi> Rom. 6.22. God hath not abſolutely promiſed
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:63179:95"/>
Salvation and eternal life to any; but he hath annexed it to certain diſpoſitions and qualifications, without which we ſhall never ſhare in the bleſſing promiſed: <hi>Bleſſed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the Law of the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 119.1. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God,</hi> Mat. 5.8. So that holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and obedience is a neceſſary diſpoſition for eternal bleſſedneſs. For God <hi>will render to every man according to his works: To them who by patient continuance in well doing, ſeek for glory, and honour, and immortality, eternal life, Rom.</hi> 2.6, 7.</p>
               <p>And therefore it plainly appears how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable a life of godlineſs is, in that it hath ſo direct a tendency to our <hi>temporal,</hi> to our <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,</hi> and to our <hi>eternal</hi> benefit. Why then ſhould any one refuſe to take up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt in his youth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Is that profitable which will abide by us for ever? which is a durable good? Such grace and holineſs is. As of evils they are the moſt detrimental that are moſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and therefore ſin is the worſt of all evils, becauſe it is durable; though the act of ſin ceaſes, yet it binds an eternal guilt upon the Soul of the wicked, which ſhall never wear off. And beſides, his corrupt nature and vicious diſpoſition, his hatred and enmity to God remain in him for ever. And therefore of all evils ſin is the moſt detrimental.</p>
               <p>So <hi>in genere boni,</hi> that is the moſt beneficial good that will abide by us for ever; and ſuch is grace and holineſs. It ſhall abide in the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:63179:96"/>
Soul for ever; and hence it is called <hi>the true riches,</hi> Luke 16.11. and <hi>durable riches,</hi> Prov. 8.18. It may be thy riches lie in houſes, lands, money, ſhips, or the like. Alas theſe are not durable; yet a little while and thy title to all theſe things will be extinguiſhed; but thy grace, thy love to God, thy holineſs, thy conformity to his will, thy obedience, ſhall never be extinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>From all that hath been ſaid, the benefit of Religion plainly appears; and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the Apoſtle ſtands firm,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.8.</note> 
                  <hi>Godlineſs is profitable to all things.</hi> And this is a ſecond branch of the reaſon why every one ſhould take up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt betimes, becauſe it is a good ſo much conducing to our bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</p>
               <p>As it ſanctifies every condition.</p>
               <p>As it is advantageous to a man in all his circumſtances.</p>
               <p>As it brings its own reward with it.</p>
               <p>As it fills the Soul with ſuch a joy as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe can.</p>
               <p>As it ſerves our temporal, ſpiritual, and eternal intereſt.</p>
               <p>As it abides by us for ever. Therefore it is not <hi>in vain to ſerve God;</hi> it is every way for your benefit to be early Converts; and if ſo, who would not be religious betimes, and take up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt in his youth, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God is ſuch <hi>a rewarder of them that dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſeek him?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11.6.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Subjection to the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt is an <hi>honourable good.</hi> The Heathens made Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:63179:96"/>
the effect of goodneſs, and the Egyptian <hi>Hieroglyphick</hi> painted it between <hi>humility</hi> and <hi>labour;</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> ſo placed their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that he that would go to the <hi>Temple of Honour</hi> muſt paſs through the <hi>Temple of Virtue.</hi> Nothing is truly honour to a man but Religion and Vertue. <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.4. <hi>By humility and the fear of the Lord</hi> (and that takes in the whole of Religion and obedience) <hi>are riches, and honour, and life.</hi> And therefore in Scripture good men are called <hi>Veſſels of honour,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.21. And ſanctification and honour are put together, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.4. <hi>That you ſhould know how to poſſeſs your veſſel in ſanctification and honour.</hi> Nothing can be ſo great an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to a man as Religion and Godlineſs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This makes a man like God. The trueſt reſemblance that man can carry to his Maker is in Holineſs; therefore one ſays <hi>Godlineſs</hi> is <hi>God-likeneſs,</hi> it is the image of God in man. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.24. <hi>That ye put on the new man which after God is created in righteouſneſs and true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</hi> And what greater honour than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble God, eſpecially in that which is the glory of all his perfections, and that is holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? His holineſs is his greateſt honour and glory. <hi>Who is like thee, O Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 15.11.</note> 
                  <hi>among the Gods? who is like thee? glorious in holineſs.</hi> For this reaſon ſin is the baſeſt and moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable thing in the world; it blots out the image of God in man. It robs him of his Holineſs, and what is a man without ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs? Take holineſs from an Angel, and he becomes a Devil: and man without holineſs is like him.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:63179:97"/>2. The Word every where puts ſuch a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and diſtinction between the godly and ungodly as ſpeaks Religion to be very honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. Good men are called the <hi>precious, The precious ſons of Sion,</hi> Lam. 4.2. <hi>Since thou waſt precious in my ſight thou haſt been honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> Iſai. 43.4. And evil men are called the <hi>vile.</hi> Pſal. 15.4. <hi>In whoſe eyes a vile perſon is contemned.</hi> Dan. 11.21. <hi>In his eſtate ſhall ſtand up a vile perſon,</hi> i. e. <hi>Antiochus.</hi> And Jer. 15.19. <hi>If thou take forth the precious from the vile.</hi> The righteous are called <hi>Wheat,</hi> and the wicked <hi>Chaff, Mat.</hi> 3.12. Others, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate ſilver;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 6.30. Lam. 4.2.</note> theſe, <hi>fine gold;</hi> others, <hi>droſs;</hi> theſe, <hi>Jewels, Mal.</hi> 3.17. they <hi>bryars</hi> and <hi>thorns,</hi> theſe a <hi>noble Vine.</hi> Nay good men are called <hi>the excellent of the earth,</hi> Pſal. 16.3. Outward ornaments, or Titles of earthly Honour, (which ſet one above another in this world) without the inward ornaments of Grace and Holineſs, are but like the Trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings of a Horſe, or the Chains of Gold about the necks of the <hi>Midianites</hi> Camels,<note place="margin">Judg. 8.26.</note> they advance not a man one ſtep above the beaſts that periſh.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God himſelf honours ſuch; and he is the fountain of honour: he whom God ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours ſhall be honoured indeed. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30. <hi>Them that honour me will I honour,</hi> Pſal. 91.14, 15. <hi>I will ſet him on high, becauſe he hath known my Name— I will be with him in trouble, I will deliver him and honour him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. True honour begins in Religion and ends there. When a man begins to owne
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:63179:97"/>
and ſerve God, there his honour begins. And when a man caſts off Religion, his honour is loſt. <hi>He that deſpiſes me ſhall be lightly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.30. <hi>Hold that faſt which thou haſt, that no man take thy crown,</hi> Rev. 3.11. A Crown is a token of the higheſt honour; and what is the Chriſtians Crown? He hath two Crowns, one preſent, one future; his future Crown is <hi>Glory.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.4.</note> His preſent Crown is godlineſs and ſincerity in Religion; if he falls from Religion, his Crown falls.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In that it is pretended to for by-ends, where nothing of the truth and power of it is. <hi>Having a form of godlineſs, but denying the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi> What makes men hypocrites but becauſe they would have the honour of Religion, though they have nothing of the truth of it. If a man would increaſe his trade, and draw cuſtom, he pretends Religion. If a man would draw Diſciples after him in broaching any new Opinion, he muſt be very ſtrict, and ſeem very religious; for this gives a reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a perſon among the vulgar, that judge by appearances, and ſo promotes the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Now if Religion were not a thing of great honour and reputation, men would never pretend to it, that are enemies to the life and virtue of it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is praiſed by them that love it not. He that fondly hugs vice, will yet commend vertue. The Drunkard will commend ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he would not have his child or ſervant a drunkard. The Deceiver commends Juſtice; and though he practiſes deceit upon others,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:63179:98"/>
he himſelf would not be ſerved ſo. He loves to buy by juſt weights and meaſures, though he ſells by falſe ones. The Adulterer loves a chaſt wife, and the filthy Strumpet would have her husband true to her bed, though ſhe be falſe to his.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It puts honour upon a man in death. <hi>The righteous ſhall be had in everlaſting remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,</hi> Pſal. 112.6. <hi>The memory of the juſt is bleſſed, but the name of the wicked ſhall rot, Prov.</hi> 10.7.

               <p n="8">8. Chriſt will put honour upon him at laſt. When the wicked ſhall be caſt out with ſhame and everlaſting contempt from the glorious preſence of God with a <hi>go ye curſed,</hi> then ſhall the righteous be honoured with a <hi>come ye bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of my Father,</hi> &amp;c. And ſhall ſhine body and ſoul with the glory of Chriſt for ever.</p>
               <p>O what an honour is it to be godly. Let no man be aſhamed of Chriſt and his <hi>Yoke.</hi> What though Religion is ſcoffed at in the world, it is only by them that know nothing of it, and ſo are not fit to judge. The Moon is never the leſs bright becauſe the dogs bark at it. It is ſin that is the reproachful thing. <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.34. <hi>Sin is a reproach to any people.</hi> It is a diſhonour, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.33. It is a ſhame, <hi>Leſt he walked naked, and they ſee his ſhame, Rev.</hi> 16.15. Sin is not a thing of good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; is it any reputation to a man to be a drunkard? unclean? proud? covetous? pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane?
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:63179:98"/>
Oh no. Sin hath an ill name in the world, among all, even ſinners themſelves, unleſs it be among the vileſt <hi>Torys</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchees;</hi> and it becomes the more odious by their eſteem and character. If there be any honour in ſin, why do men hide it? Why doth it ſeek corners and the covers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? <hi>They that are drunk are drunk in the night,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.7. <hi>The eye of the adulterer waits for the twilight, ſaying, No eye ſhall ſee me, and diſguiſes his face— The morning is to them as the ſhadow of death, if one know them they are in the terrors of the ſhadow of death.</hi> Job 24.15, 17. And <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays of the young man void of underſtanding, that he goes to the harlots houſe, <hi>In the twilight, in the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in the black and dark night,</hi> Prov. 7.7, 8, 9. And why is not ſin owned by its own name among its ſervants and abetters? But it muſt be painted with vertues colours, to render it taking. This ſpeaks it deformed and ugly in it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Covetouſneſs is condemned of all, I but frugality is a lovely thing: and therefore gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and carking, and caring, and pinching, is not covetouſneſs, but frugality. A proud per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is contemned of all. I but neatneſs and decency is lovely, therefore ſhe is not proud, but only loves to be neat and gent. To be a drunkard is a beaſtly thing, therefore it muſt not be looked on as drunkenneſs, but good fellowſhip, and a free uſe of the creature. Sin dares not be known by irs own name, nor appear in its own complexion; this argues
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:63179:99"/>
it to be a baſe and diſhonourable thing. And needs it muſt, for what honour can there be in ſin that diſhonours God? Can that bring honour to a creature that brings the greateſt diſhonour to his Maker? He that expects ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour from ſin may as well expect to make himſelf ſweet by lying in a Jakes. Can that bring honour to a man that blinds his mind, beſots his reaſon, degrades him below himſelf, and renders him a beaſt? <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.18. <hi>That they might ſee that they themſelves are beaſts.</hi> Can that be honour to a man that defiles his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſeparates him from God, and at laſt damns his Soul? Ah what a baſe, ſhameful, diſhonourable thing is ſin!</p>
               <p>Now all this ſets off the honour of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for that is contrary to ſin. Young men! would you get a good name in the world at your firſt ſetting out? Would you have cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and repute abroad? Would you be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured of men, of good men, nay of God himſelf? Why the only way is to be ſober, temperate to your ſelves, juſt, righteous, merciful, good among men, devout, humble, holy and obedient to God. There needs no other excellency in the world to give honour and reputation to a man, than Religion in the power and practice of it. What <hi>Diogenes</hi> ſaid of Vertue is moſt true of Religion, it makes <hi>poor</hi> men <hi>wealthy, old</hi> men <hi>happy,</hi> and <hi>young</hi> men <hi>honourable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is a third branch of the reaſon why every man ſhould take up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt in his youth, it is good, as being ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable.
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:63179:99"/>
                  <hi>It ſhall bring thee to honour when thou dost embrace it,</hi> Prov. 4.8.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Subjection to the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt is a <hi>pleaſant good.</hi> Every man is drawn by pleaſure and delight, eſpecially young ones. And therefore as Satan makes pleaſure the bait of ſin, ſo the Holy Ghoſt makes it the motive to godlineſs.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Her ways are ways of pleaſantneſs,</hi> Prov. 3.17. The great objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt Religion is, the ſeverity of its precepts, and thereby the unpleaſantneſs of its paths; the life of Chriſtianity is looked on as a ſour and uncomfortable life; whereas there is nothing in it but what is pleaſant and ſweet, eaſie and light. And under theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties Chriſt commends it to us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Take my yoke upon you,</hi> I but it is a heavy <hi>Yoke,</hi> and his Commands an intolerable <hi>bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi> Now Chriſt ſeems to obviate ſuch an objection as this in the next verſe, for <hi>my yoke is eaſie, and my burden is light,</hi> v. 30. And the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>His commandments are not grievous,</hi> 1 John 5.3. Not grievous in themſelves, nor grievous to them that love him; if they are grievous to any, it is to them to whom ſin was never grievous, whoſe hearts are ſo poſſeſſed by luſt, that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept hath no place; it is a hard heart that makes duty hard, and the love of ſin that makes obedience a burden. That I may make this a forcible Argument to draw young ones to take up Chriſts <hi>Yoke,</hi> I ſhall make this out, That ſubjection to God is matter of pleaſure. The whole of that task and duty which the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:63179:100"/>
Goſpel requires of us is eaſie and delightful. This I ſhall endeavour to make out three ways.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Poſitively.</item>
                  <item>2. Comparatively.</item>
                  <item>3. By a Collation of Inſtances.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. Poſitively. And there are three things to be conſidered, which will make out the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt to be truly pleaſant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The matter of his ſervice. What doth the Lord require of us, but to <hi>fear the Lord, and truſt in him,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſums it up, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.11. In <hi>Solomons</hi> phraſe it is, <hi>Fear the Lord, and depart from evil,</hi> Prov. 3.7. Our Lord Chriſt ſums up all in one word, <hi>Love.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 22.36, 37, 38, 39. Luk. 1.75.</note> 
                  <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>God</hi> and our <hi>Neighbour;</hi> this is <hi>the fulfilling of the</hi> whole <hi>Law. Zachary</hi> compriſes all in two heads; <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. Micah</hi> ranks all under three heads; <hi>To do juſtly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mic. 6.8.</note> 
                  <hi>to love mercy, to walk humbly with God.</hi> The Apoſtles three Adverbs ſtate the matter more diſtinctly; living <hi>ſoberly, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and godly.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tit. 2.11, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>The grace of God (viz.</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel) <hi>that brings ſalvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us, that denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world. Sobriety</hi> doth right to a mans ſelf, <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> doth right to his Neighbour, <hi>Godlineſs</hi> doth right to his Maker. So that theſe three make up Chriſts <hi>Yoke.</hi> They compriſe the whole of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians duty, and what unpleaſantneſs is there in any of theſe duties? Conſider them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:63179:100"/>What truer pleaſure than in <hi>Sobriety,</hi> which way ſoever it acts?</p>
               <p>If it acts to moderate the judgment <hi>in Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi> concerning Religion; to keep it from being carried away with abounding and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Errors; this muſt needs be ſweet and pleaſant, if the miſchievous nature and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of Error be but a little conſidered. As it defiles the Judgment; obſtructs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God; gratifies Satan; fills with pride, ſelf-conceit, contempt of others, ſtrife and variance; racks and tortures the Brain to maintain and defend it. For if one Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour be eſpouſed many will follow; and he that maintains one, is bound to maintain all that depend upon it.</p>
               <p>If it acts to bound the appetite in <hi>meats and drinks;</hi> it affords a great pleaſure therein. For no man injoys the creature with that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and ſweetneſs as he that injoys it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exceſs. But who can expreſs the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs and maladies of gluttony and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, the pains and diſeaſes they breed in the body, and the pangs and wounds they cauſe in the Soul?</p>
               <p>If it acts to moderate the affections in the <hi>ſeeking and injoying the things of this life;</hi> this muſt needs be a great pleaſure and eaſe; as it frees the Soul from many anxious thoughts; many vexing cares; many ſnares and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.9, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>many fooliſh and hurtful luſts which drown men in deſtruction and perdition;</hi> and <hi>pierce them through with many ſorrows.</hi> So that ſobriety is a great pleaſure as it is the cure
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:63179:101"/>

               <p>Next conſider the duty of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> as it reſpects our Neighbour; and how pleaſant and delightful is the practice of it! to be juſt in our dealings, faithful in our truſt, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to the poor, true in our teſtimony, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to all, always exemplifying in our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice that golden Rule of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 7.12.</note> 
                  <hi>Doing to others as we would that they ſhould do to us,</hi> Oh how ſweet and pleaſant muſt this be.</p>
               <p>But is there that pleaſure in Unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? no, but the contrary. Who can rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon up the clamours it cauſes without and within?

Add to this, that while unrighteouſneſs is the bane of converſation, which turns the world into a den of ſavage beaſts, where one devours another; righteouſneſs is the bond of humane Society, which conſults <hi>glory</hi> to God, <hi>honour</hi> to Religion, <hi>quietneſs</hi> to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and <hi>happineſs</hi> to Mankind.</p>
               <p>And the ſame may be ſaid of <hi>Godlineſs;</hi> there can be nothing ſo truly pleaſant and ſweet. Look upon the knowledge of God in Chriſt, and how pleaſant is that! The Scripture calls it <hi>life eternal.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Or whether you conſider the objects to which all are united that are not in union to God.

               <p>Or whether ye conſider the nature of this union, as it is ſpiritual and indiſſoluble. It is a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> union; and therefore the pleaſure of it is ſpiritual; it is not to be ſeen, nor felt, nor taſted by common ſenſes, and therefore the natural man is ſo far from receiving it,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.14.

part not, neither as to body nor Soul; for while the Soul is hereby taken up into a full communion, the body is not left alone in the grave:<note place="margin">Rom. 8.38, 39.</note> 
                  <hi>Death cannot ſeparate from the love of God in Christ.</hi> Therefore ye read of the <hi>dead in Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.16. Mark it, <hi>dead;</hi> and yet <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> though <hi>Dead.</hi> This is meant of the body, for the ſpirit dies not.

                  <note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 4.14.</note> O how ſweet muſt union to God be upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that it is <hi>indiſſoluble;</hi> though it had a beginning, it ſhall never have an end.</p>
               <p>Or whether ye look to the many and great bleſſings which flow from this union to God. Such as pardon of ſin, the grace of Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the indwelling of the Spirit; a partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of all Grace; a title to all the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and bleſſings of the Goſpel. Oh how pleaſant and ſweet muſt theſe things needs make out union to God to be.</p>
               <p>And where there is this union to God, how delightful and ſweet muſt all worſhip and ſervice, and all obedience to his commands be. For by virtue of this union to God the Believer derives ſuch power and ſtrength from him, as makes every duty not only <hi>poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,</hi> but <hi>pleaſant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And where a man is much in obedience he is much in communion; and much commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God brings in much comfort; and much comfort makes the life ſweet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant. Therefore no life to the life of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Is there pleaſure in living in Heaven?
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:63179:102"/>
Why a life of godlineſs is a converſation in Heaven, <hi>our converſation is in heaven,</hi> Phil. 3.20. Hath God pleaſure in his own life? why godlineſs is <hi>the life of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 4.18.</note> As Holineſs is the <hi>Divine nature;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.4.</note> ſo the acting of Holineſs is the <hi>Divine life:</hi> Now as the life of God, being the higheſt life, muſt neceſſarily be filled up with the higheſt pleaſures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights; ſo a Believer partaking of the life of God, which is of all the higheſt, muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably partake of the pleaſures of God, which are of all the greateſt. And thus you have the firſt conſideration which makes the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt pleaſant; and that is, the matter of his ſervice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider the ſtate in which this ſervice is commanded, and this <hi>Yoke</hi> injoyned to be put on; and that is a ſtate of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and renovation. Without this, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is not only difficult, but impoſſible. The proud neck of nature cannot bow to the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Luke 19.14.

Hence that in <hi>Ezek</hi> 36.26, 27. <hi>A new heart will I give you, and a new ſpirit will I put within you, and I will take away the ſtony heart out of your fleſh, and I will give you an heart of fleſh, and I will put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes, and ye ſhall keep my judgments and do them.</hi> So that it is firſt <hi>a new heart and a new ſpirit,</hi> and then
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:63179:103"/>
                  <hi>a new life:</hi> firſt <hi>a good tree,</hi> and then <hi>good fruit:</hi> firſt <hi>ſpiritual habits,</hi> and then <hi>spiritual acts.</hi> In Creation every creature is fitted and furniſhed with ſuch faculties and powers as are ſuitable to thoſe actions which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to its nature. So it is in the new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>We are his workmanſhip created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works,</hi> Eph. 2.10. Firſt a <hi>new creation,</hi> and then a <hi>new converſation;</hi> and this makes Duty a delight.</p>
               <p>Things are eaſie or unpleaſant according to the inclination and poiſe of our ſpirits. All pleaſure and delight in doing ariſes from a ſuitableneſs between the heart and the work; if there be <hi>Precepts</hi> upon us and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of <hi>Principles</hi> within us, much may be done, but there can be little pleaſure in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. A ſick man may eat and drink as a healthful man doth, but he hath no pleaſure in it; all things are ſavourleſs and againſt ſtomach; he hath no delight in it. But it is for other ends, that nature may be ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and life preſerved; he can't live without taking ſomething. But a man of a ſound body and healthful temper acts not only his judgment in eating, but his pleaſure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, his appetite is ſtirred up by the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that he taſtes in it. So it is with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man; ſweetneſs becomes a motive to obedience, and duty is drawn forth by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. <hi>I delight to do thy will, O my God.</hi> And mark whence this delight ſprings: <hi>Thy Law is within my heart,</hi> Pſal. 40.8. The Law was not only his <hi>Command,</hi> but his <hi>nature;</hi> God
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:63179:103"/>
writes his Law <hi>in the Word,</hi> and ſo it becomes our rule; but when he writes it <hi>in our hearts,</hi> then it becomes our <hi>nature.</hi> And this is it that makes obedience <hi>ſweet and pleaſant,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is now <hi>natural.</hi> There is an <hi>inward Principle</hi> ſuited to the <hi>outward Precept.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Conſider the pleaſures with which this ſervice is attended: It is not more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral for ſin to bring forth ſorrow and trouble, than for Religion to afford pleaſure and ſweetneſs.</p>
               <p>It denies no lawful pleaſure which others injoy.</p>
               <p>It affords pleaſures which others cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It denies no lawful pleaſures which others injoy; doth the ſinner take pleaſure in the creature? So doth the good man more truly; for Religion moderates the affections and teaches the right uſe of the creature, and thereby heightens the pleaſure of the injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it curbs and reſtrains our exceſſes; and moderated affections make our fruition the more ſweet; becauſe hereby ſin is exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded which imbitters the injoyment. There is no pleaſure which a wicked man ſins in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying, but a good man may injoy without ſin; and where there is leaſt ſin there is moſt ſweetneſs.</p>
               <p>Nay farther, Religion <hi>spiritualizeth</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment; and thereby a good man hath more ſweetneſs in the creature than any other can have; as the <hi>Bee</hi> hath more delight in the flower than other creatures can; becauſe
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:63179:104"/>
they have only the ſweetneſs of the <hi>ſcent,</hi> but the <hi>Bee</hi> hath the ſweetneſs of the <hi>honey</hi> with the <hi>ſcent.</hi> Natural man hath only a <hi>natural</hi> ſweetneſs; but the ſpiritual man hath a <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> ſweetneſs with the <hi>natural,</hi> and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys a higher pleaſure in the creature than any natural man can.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Religion hath its peculiar plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which none but good men can partake of. It gives pleaſure and delight in God, when the creature affords none. The ſenſual man is beholden to the <hi>Fig-tree,</hi> and the <hi>Vine,</hi> and the <hi>Olive;</hi> to the <hi>Field,</hi> the <hi>Fold,</hi> and the <hi>Stall;</hi> if theſe fail, his comfort fails. But the good man hath a never-ſailing Spring of delight when all theſe ſtreams are cut off. <hi>Although the fig-tree ſhall not bloſſom, neither ſhall fruit be in the vines, the labour of the olive ſhall ſail, and the fields ſhall yield no meat, the flock ſhall be cut off from the fold, and there ſhall be no herd in the ſtalls.</hi> Here are all his ſtreams cut off; now where is his never-failing Spring? why it is in God. <hi>Yet I will rejoyce in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Habak. 3.17, 18.</p>
               <p>No delight ſo ſweet as delight in God. The dim light of Moon and Stars are a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble miniſtry in a dark night, and we are glad to walk by the light of them; but when once the light of the Sun breaks out, who regards the Moon or Stars then? Creature-comforts are pleaſant things to a ſenſual Spirit that knows no better injoyment; but when once God diſcovers himſelf to the Soul, and <hi>ſheds
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:63179:104"/>
abroad his love in the heart,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 5.5.</note> what poor things are theſe then?</p>
               <p>The pleaſure of <hi>walking with God,</hi> and the pleaſure of a <hi>witneſſing Conſcience,</hi> (without naming any more) outvie all the pleaſures in the World for ſweetneſs and delight. And theſe are peculiar to Religion and a life of godlineſs;<note place="margin">Prov. 14.10.</note> 
                  <hi>no ſtranger intermeddles with this joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. In Religion and the practice of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs a good man walks with God. There is a twofold walking with God, and both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſweet.</p>
               <p>In Holineſs and Obedience.</p>
               <p>In Comfort and Experience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> There is a walking with God in <hi>Comfort and Experience;</hi> and this conſiſts in ſenſible communion and fellowſhip with God. This is that our Lord Chriſt injoyed much of: <hi>John</hi> 16.32. <hi>I am not alone, becauſe the Father is with me.</hi> He had much of it in that Voice from Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.17. <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> He had much of it in the Transfiguration, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.2. <hi>He was transfigured before them;</hi> this imports a wonderful letting forth of the glory of God upon him, and ſo ſpeaks an high degree of communion.<note place="margin">Exod. 34.29.</note> 
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> had a great meaſure of this transfiguring communion in the Mount when <hi>his face ſhone;</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> when he ſays he cannot tell <hi>whether</hi> he was <hi>in the body or out of the body;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.3, 4.</note> but ſpeaks as though he had been really in Heaven. Theſe are extraordinary manifeſtations of God which are fitted only
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:63179:105"/>
to ſpecial ſeaſons; and though they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſweet, and fill the Soul with great tranſports of joy; yet they are not deſigned for continuance, nor alotted to many.</p>
               <p>But there is a more ordinary communion with God which every good man may lay claim to: The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of it as the undoubted priviledge of every Believer, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Truly our fellowſhip is with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And Chriſt promiſes it to all that obey his Commands: <hi>John</hi> 14.21. <hi>He that hath my commandments and keepeth them loveth me, and he that loveth me ſhall be loved of my Father, and I will love him and will manifeſt my ſelf to him.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 23. <hi>We will come unto him and make our abode with him.</hi> Theſe expreſſions import a ſpecial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, and peculiar emanations of his love, filling the Soul with ſuch a ſweetneſs and delight as none elſe can experience. Hence that of <hi>Judas</hi> (not Iſcariot) to Chriſt, in <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>Lord, how is it that thou wilt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest thy ſelf to us and not to the world?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a comfort the world knows nothing of Indeed a Believer himſelf hath no ſecurity of injoying it always. As one Believer injoys it more than another; and the ſame Believer injoys it more at one time than another; ſo ſometimes he injoys it not. God never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to any man ſuch a vouchſafement of his comſorting preſence as ſhould know no interruption; for if ſo, then God would leave himſelf without a liberty to ſhew his diſlike of ſin. That promiſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. <hi>I
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:63179:105"/>
will never leave thee nor forſake thee,</hi> ſecures to a Believer the duration of his union, but not of his communion; it intitles him to the certainty of his preſence, and care of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; but not to the light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. It makes over to him the conſtant ſupports of his Power and Grace, but not always the actual poſſeſſion of joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is a walking with God in <hi>Holineſs and Obedience:</hi> Thus it is ſaid <hi>Enoch walked with God three hundred years,</hi> Gen. 5.22. that is, by an holy conformity to his will *. To live to the will of God; loving what God loves; hating what God hates; doing what God commands; this is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt kind of walking and communion with God; for it is a communion with him in his own nature, which is holineſs. Now thus every good man walks with God, and hath a daily communion with him, ſo far as holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is in exerciſe.</p>
               <p>How often may we hear the Children of God complaining of the want of communion with God! this ariſes from a miſtake of the thing. They judge of fellowſhip by ſenſible fruitions; and of <hi>communion</hi> by <hi>comfort.</hi> So much as God gives out of the comfort of his preſence, and the light of his face, ſo much communion they partake of. And where this is not injoyed, there all communion is denied. Whereas communion with God may be maintained and yet preſent comfort may be left out. Though they cannot walk
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:63179:106"/>
by the <hi>light of his countenance,</hi> yet they may walk by the <hi>light of his counſels.</hi> So did <hi>Job</hi> (Chap. 23.8, 9, 10, 11, 12.) <hi>Behold I go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but he is not there; backward, but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perceive him; on the left hand where he doth work, but I can't behold him; he hides himſelf on the right hand, that I cannot ſee him. But he knows the way that I take,—my foot hath held his ſteps, his way have I kept and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined. Neither have I gone back from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of his lips.</hi> Here you may ſee <hi>Job</hi> walking with God, when at the ſame time he cannot find him. He walketh by the light of his <hi>will revealed,</hi> when he can't walk by the light of his <hi>face diſcovered;</hi> and ſo hath a communion with him in his <hi>counſels,</hi> though not in the <hi>light of his countenance.</hi> And this makes the <hi>Yoke</hi> of obedience pleaſant, it is a walking with God; you have hereby communion with him in his Holineſs, when you want the comforts of his preſence; and this makes your <hi>way ſweet,</hi> though God doth not ſhine upon your <hi>path.</hi> This I take to be the meaning of that of <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 112.4. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the upright there ariſeth light in darkneſs. Holineſs</hi> yields a ſweetneſs and comfort, when it may be the <hi>light of Gods face</hi> yields none.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Godlineſs is attended with the pleaſure of a <hi>witneſſing Conſcience.</hi> He that follows its guidance ſhall never want its <hi>witneſs.</hi> God leads man by a twofold guide; the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Conſcience;</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> without, and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> within; the <hi>Word</hi> is a light <hi>to</hi> us, and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:63179:106"/>
                  <hi>Conſcience</hi> is a light <hi>in</hi> us; the <hi>Word</hi> directs the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and <hi>Conſcience</hi> directs the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</hi> And he that follows the guidance of <hi>Conſcience</hi> as it is guided by the <hi>Word,</hi> ſhall never want a witneſs to the goodneſs of his ſtate and heart. He that oppoſes and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences Conſcience, ſhall find it witneſſing <hi>against him;</hi> but he that is guided by it, ſhall have it a witneſs <hi>for him.</hi> As the Spirit of God is firſt a <hi>Counſeller,</hi> and then a <hi>Comforter;</hi> ſo Conſcience is firſt a <hi>guide,</hi> and then a <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what greater pleaſure than the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a mans Conſcience to the goodneſs of his converſation? As a <hi>condemning Conſcience</hi> is the greateſt <hi>torment,</hi> as being a degree of Hell; ſo a <hi>witneſſing Conſcience</hi> is the greateſt <hi>comfort</hi> as being a firſt-fruits of the joy of Heaven. <hi>Our rejoycing is this, the teſtimony of our conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, not with fleſhly wiſdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our converſation in the world,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. A witneſſing Conſcience brings with it an unſpeakable ſweetneſs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. As for inſtance.</p>
               <p>Firſt, What is it that ſatisfies a man when nothing elſe can? it is the witneſs of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. <hi>A good man is ſatisfied from himſelf,</hi> Prov. 14.14.</p>
               <p>Secondly, What is it that gives confidence and boldneſs towards God? it is a witneſſing Conſcience. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.21. <hi>If our hearts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us not, then have we confidence towards God:</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, we have boldneſs; ſo
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:63179:107"/>
the word is rendred in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19. <hi>Having, brethren, boldneſs to enter into the holieſt by the blood of Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A good man hath a threefold boldneſs and confidence from a witneſſing Conſcience.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A boldneſs in Prayer, <hi>Let us come boldly to the throne of grace,</hi> Heb. 4.16. There are three things which together cauſe this bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Throne God is upon, to whom we make our requeſts: <hi>viz.</hi> a Throne of Grace and Mercy; <hi>Let us come boldly to the throne of grace,</hi> Heb. 4.16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The advantage we have by Jeſus Chriſt at the right hand of God; <hi>Who ever lives to make interceſſion for us,</hi> Heb. 7.15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The help of the Spirit; whereby we are inabled to call him Father; and who <hi>makes interceſſion in us,</hi> Rom. 8.15, 26.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Boldneſs and confidence in the midſt of all dangers: <hi>He ſhall not be afraid of evil ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,</hi> Pſal. 112.7. <hi>Though I walk through the valley of the ſhadow of death, yet will I fear no evil,</hi> Pſal. 23.4. <hi>The righteous is bold as a lion,</hi> Prov. 28.1.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Boldneſs and confidence in the day of Judgment: 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.17. <hi>That we may have boldneſs in the day of judgment.</hi> And how ſweet muſt this be, to dye and go to the Bar of God, confidently aſſured of the goodneſs of our caſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, What is that which comforts and ſupports a man when all elſe (it may be) witneſs againſt him? It is a witneſſing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:63179:107"/>Sometimes men may witneſs againſt him, and falſly charge him, as in <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe; yet then Conſcience ſupports him; in the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony whereof he can appeal to God, as in Chap. 10.7. <hi>Thou knoweſt that I am not wicked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes God ſeems to witneſs againſt him, <hi>Thou writeſt bitter things against me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 10.17.</note> Job 13.26. Yet then <hi>to the upright there ariſes light in darkneſs,</hi> Pſal. 112.4.</p>
               <p>Sometimes Satan witneſſeth againſt a man; accuſes him of hypocriſie and unſoundneſs of heart in the ways of God, as he did <hi>Job</hi> of ſerving God for by-ends, <hi>Job</hi> 1.9, 10. yet then Conſcience ſupports him, as it did good <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> in the teſtimony whereof he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals to God, <hi>Remember, Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſai. 38.3.</note> 
                  <hi>how I have walked before thee with an upright heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, What is that which fills the Soul with peace and joy when troubles and diſtreſſes are upon us? it is the witneſs of Conſcience. This made <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> ſing in the Stocks. This made the Martyrs tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in the midſt of the flames. <hi>As ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, yet always rejoycing,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.10. O what a ſweet thing is a witneſſing Conſcience! it fills a man with the richeſt and the moſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting peace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. With the richeſt peace; and therefore it is called the Peace of God: <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7. <hi>The peace of God which paſſeth all underſtanding ſhall keep your hearts and minds through faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> That this is the peace of Conſcience is evident, in that it is ſaid to <hi>keep the heart
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:63179:108"/>
and mind.</hi> And it is called the Peace of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe of the greatneſs and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of it; according to that Hebraiſm whereby things great and excellent are inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled to God.<note place="margin">Pſal. 36.6.</note> As the <hi>mountains of God,</hi> the <hi>Cedars of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 80.10.</note> the <hi>increaſe of God,</hi> Col. 2.19, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe he gives it. <hi>When he gives peace, who can make trouble?</hi> Job 34.29. All the world cannot give peace to a troubled Conſcience.<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 10.19.</note> 
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>Money anſwers all things.</hi> But it can never anſwer the doubts and diſtreſſes of Conſcience. It is God that ſpeaks peace there, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To diſtinguiſh it from the worlds peace, which is a carnal peace, an outward peace, a falſe peace; but the peace God gives is a true peace, an inward and ſpiritual peace, <hi>John</hi> 14.27.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It fills a man with the moſt laſting peace: Therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> calls it <hi>a continual feaſt,</hi> Prov. 15.15. Not a feaſt for a day, as <hi>Nabals</hi> was;<note place="margin">Judg. 14.12.</note> nor for ſeven days, as <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> was; nor for an hundred and eighty days, as that of <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> was;<note place="margin">Eſth. 1.4.</note> but a continual feaſt, without intermiſſion and without end. A Heathen could ſay, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, A good man is always feaſting, he hath the continual entertainment and delight of a quiet Conſci<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ence. He may meet with many troubles and ſorrows and afflictions, but his peace and joy ſhall out-live them all. His eſtate may be waſted, his name reproached, his body burned, but his peace and joy can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:63179:108"/>
be touched. It lyes out of the world's reach. It is from Heaven, and will abide in the Soul till it be conſummated by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Chriſt in that heart-raviſhing Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <hi>Well done good and faithful ſervant,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 25.21.</note> 
                  <hi>enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus ſubjection and obedience to the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt appears to be <hi>a pleaſant good,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye look to the matter of his ſervice, or to the ſtate in which this ſervice is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or to the ſweetneſs with which it is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. And thus you have the truth of it made out poſitively.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of pleaſure and delight, may be made out comparatively.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Compare it with the <hi>Yoke</hi> of the Law, either Ceremonial or Moral.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Compare it with the <hi>Yoke</hi> of the Ceremonial Law, and Chriſts <hi>Yoke</hi> is much eaſier than that. And this will appear,</p>
               <p>If you look to the obſervances and impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of one and the other. How numerous and chargeable were the obſervances of that Law; how many and how coſtly were their Sacrifices.</p>
               <p>Some were <hi>gratulatory;</hi> appointed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their grateful ſenſe of mercies received: theſe you read of <hi>Lev.</hi> 7.12, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Some were <hi>expiatory;</hi> theſe were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to atone for ſin, to pacifie Gods anger, to remove guilt, and divert judgment; and how many and various were they. Some were to be of the <hi>herd,</hi> as <hi>oxen</hi> and <hi>heiſers;</hi> ſome
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:63179:109"/>
of the <hi>flock,</hi> as <hi>ſheep</hi> and <hi>lambs, goats</hi> and <hi>kids.</hi> Some of <hi>fowl,</hi> as <hi>turtle-doves</hi> and <hi>pigeons.</hi> Some were to be of what grew out of the <hi>earth,</hi> as <hi>corn</hi> and <hi>wine, oyl</hi> and <hi>spices.</hi> And of theſe, ſome were <hi>burnt-offerings;</hi> ſome <hi>meat-offerings;</hi> ſome <hi>ſin-offerings;</hi> ſome <hi>treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs-offerings.</hi> And ſome of them were to be offered but <hi>once a year;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Levit. 16. Exod. 12. Levit. 23.16. Numb. 29.12. Numb. 28.11. Num. 28.9. Num. 28.3, 4, 5.</note> ſome at their ſolemn Feaſts, as the <hi>Paſſover, Pentecoſt,</hi> and the Feaſt of <hi>Tabernacles.</hi> Some every <hi>New-moon;</hi> ſome every <hi>Sabbath day;</hi> ſome were to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered <hi>every day,</hi> and that both <hi>morning</hi> and <hi>evening,</hi> as the <hi>daily Sacrifice,</hi> and ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſpecial occaſions, which were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many; for if any man did but touch an unclean thing, he muſt come and offer a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</p>
               <p>From all which numerous obſervances that <hi>Yoke</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt needs be very burdenſom; if we now were for every ſin to offer a Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock or a Lamb, what a burden ſhould we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it: if Conſcience did not make ſin a burden, the charge and expence would; and ſo it did to the Jews, therefore it is called a <hi>Yoke,</hi> and that a heavy one, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10. <hi>A yoke which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear.</hi> In calling theſe things <hi>a yoke too hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to be born,</hi> it ſhews their obſervance of them was more becauſe God commanded them, than becauſe of any intrinſecal good that was in them. They bore the <hi>Yoke</hi> till God took it off, but it was a very heavy <hi>Yoke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt is eaſie on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; his commands are few and facil; not burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:63179:109"/>
but beneficial; as really our priviledge as our duty. And therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> comparing the ſtate of the Church then, with what it is under the Goſpel, calls it <hi>Bondage, Gal.</hi> 4.3. when <hi>we were children, we were in bondage under the elements of the world:</hi> By the Elements of the world the <hi>carnal Sacrifices</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the Law are intended, by which, as by firſt rudiments, God did then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the Church in its minority. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he calls the ſtate of the Goſpel-Church a ſtate of <hi>freedom.</hi> Gal. 5.1. <hi>Stand faſt in the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made us free, and be not intangled again with the yoke of bondage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O how ſweet and eaſie is the ſervice of the Goſpel! The Covenant of Grace is made with us without thoſe burdens and bonds which became their bondage; what a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſhould this be to a willing and chearful obedience. Chriſt hath therefore made us free that we ſhould ſerve him freely. Our freedom from bondage by the liberty of the Goſpel ſhould ſtrengthen our bonds to all Goſpel-obedience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Compare the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt with the <hi>Yoke</hi> of the Moral Law as a Covenant of Works; and it will appear far more eaſie, if you conſider five things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Law requires very difficult ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but contributes no aſſiſtance; ſo that a mans work is above his ſtrength; and where duty is great, and ſtrength little, it becomes a burden intolerable. If a man ſhould be ſet to remove a mountain, to fetch a Star from
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:63179:110"/>
Heaven, to keep out the Tide of the Sea, how impoſſible would this be. So is obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Law in our preſent ſtate of impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency: and hence it becomes a bondage and burden. Why is the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> called the <hi>houſe of bondage</hi> to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but becauſe they were required to make the ſame tale of brick without ſtraw, as before they did when ſtraw was provided for them? So the Law requires the ſame obedience of fallen man in a ſtate of weakneſs, as it did of innocent <hi>Adam</hi> in his full ſtrength.</p>
               <p>But in the Goſpel-Covenant there is no duty injoyned but there is a power of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance vouchſafed: and no commandment can be grievous where the aſſiſtance is ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the ſervice. That one command of <hi>believing</hi> is in it ſelf more difficult than any precept of the Law:<note place="margin">Eph. 2.8.</note> but if <hi>faith</hi> be <hi>the gift of God,</hi> then how eaſie is it to believe, whatever God wills is eaſie to be done when <hi>he</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>works in us to will and to do.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 2.13.</note> This makes the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt <hi>eaſie,</hi> that there is power conveyed with the precept: <hi>jubet &amp; juvat.</hi> It is with us as with the man that lay at the gate of the Temple, who had been lame from the womb, <hi>Peter</hi> commands him <hi>in the name of Jeſus to riſe up and walk, and immediately his feet and ankle-bones received ſtrength,</hi> Acts 3.2, 6, 7. There is a power conveyed by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. So it is here; and therefore we ſhould do as the lame man did; How is that? the eighth verſe tells you, <hi>He ſtood, and walked, and entred into the Temple, walking, and leaping, and praiſing God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:63179:110"/>Secondly, The Law required a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs veſted in the perſon. It muſt not be anothers doing but our own. The Law ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of no <hi>days-man,</hi> no Mediator, no help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Anothers doing could no way be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as ours, nor anothers righteouſneſs be any benefit to us. Every man muſt ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own bottom.</p>
               <p>But the Goſpel-Covenant admits of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator; one to come in between God and man; therefore he is called <hi>The Mediator of the new Teſtament,</hi> Heb. 9.15. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24. <hi>Jeſus the Mediator of the new Covenant.</hi> It admits of anothers righteouſneſs inſtead of our own, and allows us as real benefit by it as if it had been done in our own perſons. <hi>He was made ſin for us who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. <hi>As by one mans diſobedience ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were made ſinners,</hi> that is Law, <hi>ſo by the obedience of one ſhall many be made righteous, Rom.</hi> 5.19. this is pure Goſpel. And hence Jeſus Chriſt is ſtiled, <hi>The Lord our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Jer. 23.6. And hence we are ſaid to be <hi>accepted in the Beloved,</hi> Eph. 1.6. and to be <hi>compleat in him,</hi> Col. 2.10. And how pleaſant doth this make the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt to be.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Under the Law it was not enough that obedience was perſonal, unleſs it was alſo perfect and perpetual. Any one ſin done at any time marr'd all; <hi>All his righteouſneſs ſhall be forgotten,</hi> Ezek. 18.24. <hi>Curſed is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that continueth not in all things which are
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:63179:111"/>
written in the Law to do them,</hi> Gal. 3.10. A man periſhed as really by the guilt of one ſin as of ten thouſand. <hi>The judgment was by one to condemnation,</hi> Rom. 5.16. that is, <hi>by one ſin,</hi> for ſo the next words explain it; <hi>but the free gift is of many offences to juſtification.</hi> The Apoſtle here commends the grace of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel by comparing it with the Laws rigour, The Goſpel juſtifies from <hi>many offences,</hi> when the Law condemns for <hi>any one.</hi> He that fails in any one thing is gone for ever. Nothing is accepted but what is perfect. The beſt <hi>affections</hi> will not excuſe failure in <hi>actions,</hi> nor deſires to do, eke out the weakneſs of doing.</p>
               <p>But under the Goſpel, <hi>where there is a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling mind, it is accepted according to what a man hath;</hi> where the arm is ſhort, it is made up by uprightneſs of heart. Where the will is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the power, God accepts the will, and paſſes by the weakneſs. If a man ſincerely deſires and endeavours to do what he cannot do, the truth of affection is accepted for acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and God counts <hi>the deſire of a man</hi> to be <hi>his kindneſs,</hi> Prov. 19.22. Though that plea of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. <hi>To will is preſent with me, but how to perform that which is good I find not,</hi> finds no room under the Law, yet it is a good plea under the Goſpel. O how ſweet is this!</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Under the Law there was no room for repentance. One tranſgreſſion diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annulled that Covenant, and no repentance, no ſorrow, no tears could ever make it up
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:63179:111"/>
again. Where perſonal, perfect obedience is the condition of life, there can be no room for repentance.</p>
               <p>But this is one of the great priviledges of the Goſpel-Covenant, that failures in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience may be made up by repentance. And hence it is that we are ſo often called to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> with a promiſe of <hi>healing our backslidings.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 3.22.</note> Did God ever call <hi>Adam</hi> under the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to return when he ran away from God? no never, but drove him out of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.24. <hi>So he drove out the man, and he placed at the Eaſt of the garden Cherubims and a flaming ſword, which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life.</hi> But under the Goſpel how frequently are we called to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and repent. Though the firſt Covenant was diſſolved by one ſin; yet many ſins can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſſolve the Goſpel-Covenant. <hi>For the free gift is of many offences to juſtification,</hi> Rom. 5 16. This makes the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, that their failures and neglects may be repented of and find forgiveneſs. For <hi>God hath exalted Chriſt to be a Prince and a Saviour to give repentance and remiſſion of ſins,</hi> Acts 5.31.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The cords that bound on the <hi>Yoke</hi> of the firſt Covenant were threats and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. The Law requires obedience upon pain of a Curſe: <hi>Curſed be he that makes a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven image, which is an abomination to the Lord,</hi> Deut. 27.15, <hi>Curſed be he that ſetteth light by father or mother,</hi> v. 16. <hi>Curſed is every one that continues not in all things written in the Law
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:63179:112"/>
to do them,</hi> Gal. 3.10. and this Curſe is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death. But the cords that bind on the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt are not terrors, but love and mercy. <hi>I beſeech you, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you preſent your ſelves a living ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your reaſonable ſervice,</hi> Rom. 12.1. And this makes the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt far more ſweet and pleaſant than the <hi>Yoke</hi> of the Law.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let's compare the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt with the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Sin, and it will appear infinitely more pleaſant than that can be. The plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſin hold no compariſon with the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Religion and godlineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The pleaſures of ſin are ſenſual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; ſuch as gratifie only the fleſh, and pleaſe the brutiſh part; and the more any man gives himſelf up to them, the more he puts off man, and ſinks down into the nature of beaſt; and therefore many Heathens have upon meer principles of reaſon aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned ſenſual pleaſures as inferior to them, and have judged him unworthy the name of a man that could ſpend one day in purſuit of them. But the pleaſures of Religion are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional pleaſures, they are ſuch as are ſuited to the rules of right reaſon; pleaſures that gratifie the inward man, and feed the love and delight of an immortal Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The pleaſures of ſin are debaſing pleaſures: and this follows from the former. The more ſenſual any man is, the more doth he debaſe his nature.<note place="margin">Luke 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.16.</note> He is, like the <hi>Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> feeding upon husks with the Swine, and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:63179:112"/>
hence it is that the Lord, by <hi>Amos,</hi> calls thoſe Rulers in <hi>Samaria, Kine of Baſhan,</hi> Amos 4.1. <hi>Hear this word, ye kine of Baſhan, that are in the mountain of Samaria.</hi> Becauſe they forgot the Lord, and gave themſelves up to their luſts and ſenſual pleaſures, therefore he rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons them among the beaſts; <hi>Kine of Baſhan,</hi> more like beaſts than men. The pleaſures of ſin are a very debaſing thing. Hence the ſame word in the Hebrew which the Scripture uſes for a ſenſual <hi>Glutton,</hi> is uſed for a <hi>vile perſon. This our ſon is a glutton.</hi> Deut. 21.20 <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>if thou take forth the precious from the vile,</hi> Jer. 15.19. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> There is the ſame word for both: and it intimates to us that no man is more vile than he that gives up himſelf to ſenſuality. And therefore the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> writing to young men not to love the world, tells them,<note place="margin">1 John 2.15, 16.</note> That <hi>all that is in the world is but the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Ambitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus honos, &amp; opes, &amp; foeda volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptas, Haec tria pro trino numine mundus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet.</note>. He calls ſinful pleaſures <hi>Luſt,</hi> becauſe they are food and fuel for luſt: and he calls them the <hi>Luſt of the fleſh,</hi> to intimate to us the defiling and debaſing quality of them.</p>
               <p>But the pleaſures of Religion are inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling pleaſures. Take that one pleaſure of communion with God for an inſtance, and there is nothing that doth raiſe and innoble the Soul like it. <hi>I will ſet him on high, becauſe he hath known my name,</hi> Pſal. 91.14. As God is infinitely above all other objects, ſo the pleaſure of communion with him muſt far tranſcend all other pleaſures; and put a dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:63179:113"/>
upon the Soul, which no other commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion can; and hence it is that <hi>the righteous is</hi> ſaid to be <hi>more excellent than his neighbour, Prov.</hi> 12.26. As upon other accounts, ſo upon this, that he hath a more excellent fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, and lives upon more excellent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments and delights. The perfection of the reaſonable Creature conſiſts in its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with ſuch a good as is above it ſelf, and above all created Beings<note n="*" place="margin">Quodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet perfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur eo quod ſubditur ſuo ſuperiori. <hi>Aquin.</hi>
                  </note>. And ſuch is that communion the good man injoys.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The pleaſures of ſin are deceitful pleaſures: like thoſe beautiful Apples that when touched are ſaid to turn to aſhes. They are not that in the fruition as they are in the expectation. Hence ye read of <hi>deceitful luſts, Eph.</hi> 4.22. and <hi>the deceitfulneſs of ſin,</hi> Heb. 3.13. And one of ſins great deceits lies in this, it draws the Soul to a compliance upon a vain hope of injoying the pleaſure it never finds. The true nature of <hi>deceit</hi> lies in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting things to the mind otherwiſe than they are. Sin never preſents it ſelf in its own colours, but takes up the ſhape of ſome ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, covetouſneſs is a wiſe thrift; exceſs and waſte is liberality; Superſtitition is a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous devoutneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it ever flatters the expectation, and raiſes a falſe hope of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and pleaſure. And therefore the Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſays, <hi>The folly of fools is deceit,</hi> Prov. 14.8. Every man propoſes a happineſs to himſelf in all that he doth, and ſo doth the ſinner; but ſeeking it in the way of his luſts he deceives himſelf, and ſo becomes a fool.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:63179:113"/>
Sin promiſes much, and the Sinner expects much; but he never finds what he expects, becauſe ſin never performs what it promiſes; and hence it is called a <hi>lying vanity,</hi> Jon. 2.8. There is no reality in it, it is <hi>res nihili,</hi> a thing of nought. The pleaſure of ſin is but the pleaſure of a dream.</p>
               <p>Two things make us think ſin pleaſant and delightful.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ſubtilty of Satans temptations; one part whereof (and not the leaſt) lies in tempting to ſin by the bait of pleaſure; this was Satans firſt device for the bringing ſin into the world; how did he <hi>beguile</hi> our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents? but by a fruit that was <hi>pleaſant to the eye,</hi> and <hi>deſirable to make one wiſe,</hi> Gen. 3.6. And hence Satan takes advantage to looſen their hearts from God by inſinuating ſecretly as if God envied the felicity of Mankind, and that it was meerly an abridgment of their happineſs God aimed at in forbidding them to eat of that fruit that was ſo beneficial, ſo pleaſant, ſo deſirable. <hi>God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof your eyes ſhall be opened, and ye ſhall be as Gods knowing good and evil, v.</hi> 5. And by this bait of delight and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure were they caught and deceived.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.14. Gen. 29.19, 23.</note> As <hi>Laban</hi> promiſed <hi>Jacob</hi> a fair <hi>Rachel,</hi> but laid a blear-eyed <hi>Leah</hi> in her room. So Satan promiſes pleaſure and delight in ſin, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms in ſorrow and diſappointment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A corrupted imagination, and a delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded fancy: and this is a fruit of the former, and Satan hath no ſmall hand in it. For the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:63179:114"/>
office of the imagination being to ſupply the mind with variety of objects whereon to work, and to quicken, allure, and ſharpen the will accordingly; therefore Satan by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting this, bids fair for the corrupting the underſtanding and will alſo. He can inject ſtrange ſpecies, and impreſs falſe images of things upon the fancy with ſuch ſubtilty and eaſe, as ſhall readily gain them credit in the mind, and admittance in the will. And hence all that pleaſure that the ſinner hath in ſin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it is the fruit of a deluded fancy and imagination; ſo ſays the Prophet, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 44.20. <hi>He feedeth on aſhes, a deceived heart hath turned him aſide, that he cannot deliver his ſoul, nor ſay, Is there not a lye in my right hand?</hi> A man may as ſoon ſtay his hunger with eating aſhes, as find true pleaſure in ſin; and were not his heart deceived, he would eaſily ſee and ſay that it is <hi>a lye</hi> that he embraces and holds ſo faſt.</p>
               <p>But the pleaſures of godlineſs are true plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; not windy and frothy delights, but ſubſtantial and real. Though the ſinner <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects</hi> more pleaſure in ſin than he <hi>finds;</hi> yet the good man <hi>finds</hi> more pleaſure in the ways of Chriſt than he did <hi>expect.</hi> As Servants that are in good places, they meet with great vails beſides their wages; ſo beſides the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of godlineſs in the next world, it is rewarded with great pleaſures and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in this. <hi>This I had becauſe I kept thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,</hi> Pſal. 119.56. this experience, this peace, this joy: <hi>For the kingdom of heaven is
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:63179:114"/>
not meat and drink, but righteouſneſs and peace and joy in the holy Ghoſt,</hi> Rom. 14.17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The pleaſures of ſin are pleaſures that cauſe ſhame. And this ariſes from the former; for if the pleaſures of ſin are deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, they muſt needs cauſe ſhame. Shame is either from the diſappointment of hope, or from unbecoming and unworthy actions. Now the pleaſures of ſin cauſe ſhame on both theſe accounts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As they diſappoint our hope, <hi>Job</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>troops of Tema</hi> that came to the dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed brooks expecting water, and finding none, ſays, <hi>They were confounded becauſe they had ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, they came thither and were aſhamed,</hi> Job 6.20. So the ſimple ſinner betakes himſelf to his luſts, expecting pleaſure, but meets with diſappointment, and returns aſhamed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The pleaſures of ſin cauſe ſhame as they ſlow from unbecoming actions: <hi>Pudor eſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientia turpitudinis;</hi> it is a conſciouſneſs of ſomewhat that is baſe; a man may be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med either before <hi>God,</hi> or before <hi>others,</hi> or before <hi>himſelf.</hi> Taking pleaſure in ſin cauſes ſhame before all theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Before <hi>God,</hi> and that both here and hereafter.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It cauſes ſhame <hi>here.</hi> Where there is any ſenſe of God, and ingenuity of Spirit, conſciouſneſs of guilt puts the Soul to the bluſh when it would have to do with God in its approaches. <hi>O my God, I am aſhamed and bluſh to lift up my face to thee, for our iniquities are increaſed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.6. So it is ſaid of
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:63179:115"/>
the <hi>Publican,</hi> that when he went into the Temple to pray, <hi>he ſtood afar off, and would not lift up ſo much as his eyes to heaven,</hi> Luke 18.13. Theſe are poſtures by which great ſhame and confuſion of face is expreſſed. Or if any be hardned under ſin as not to be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med here, yet</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He ſhall be aſhamed before God <hi>hereafter.</hi> Many that now dare, though in their ſins and luſts, make ſolemn approaches to God, will be aſhamed and confounded to appear at the Judgment-ſeat of God. <hi>David</hi> ſays,<note place="margin">Pſal. 1.5.</note> 
                  <hi>The wicked ſhall not ſtand in judgment, Pſal.</hi> 1.5. Indeed there are few that ſhall: <hi>The great day of his wrath is come, and who ſhall be able to ſtand?</hi> Revel. 6.17. Sinners that now are grown impudent in ſin, that have a <hi>Whores forehead,</hi> that have took their degree in the <hi>Scorners chair,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 1.1.</note> that are paſt ſhame, ſhall then be aſhamed and confounded for ever. And there are three things in the proceſs of that day which ſhall cauſe it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The diſcovery of ſin which ſhall then be made. For all the wickedneſs that ever the ſinner committed ſhall then be made known: <hi>God will bring every work into judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with every ſecret thing, whether it be good or evil,</hi> Eccleſ. 12.14. There is not a cloſet-ſin, nor the moſt concealed iniquity, but ſhall then be made publick. <hi>God will then bring to light the hidden things of darkneſs, and make manifeſt the counſels of the heart, and then ſhall every man</hi> (that is, every good man) <hi>have praiſe of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.5. But what ſhall
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:63179:115"/>
become of ſinners? ſure they ſhall be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The utter fruſtration of the ſinners hope. So long as hope laſts ſhame hath no place: now many a mans hope laſts to the day of Judgment; they maintain a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the goodneſs of their eſtate, which nothing but the light of that day can confute. So did they in <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22. <hi>Many will ſay unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied in thy name, and in thy name caſt out de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and in thy name done many wonderful works.</hi> So did the fooliſh Virgins till <hi>the door was ſhut, Mat.</hi> 25.10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The contempt that God ſhall put upon them when he ſhall eternally baniſh them his preſence by the dreadful Sentence that he ſhall then paſs againſt them: <hi>Depart from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire prepared for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and his Angels,</hi> Mat. 25.41. By the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this Sentence they ſhall become the ſcorn and contempt of all the Saints and Angels in Heaven. Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>They that ſleep in the duſt of the earth ſhall ariſe, ſome to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, and ſome to ſhame and everlaſting contempt,</hi> Dan. 12.2.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Taking pleaſure in ſin cauſes ſhame before <hi>others.</hi> God by one means or other will bring ſuch ſinners to open ſhame: <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.26. <hi>I will diſcover thy skirts, that thy ſhame may appear.</hi> And <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.37. <hi>I will gather all thy lovers with whom thou haſt taken pleaſure, and all them thou haſt hated,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 23.29.</note> 
                  <hi>and will diſcover thy nakedneſs to them, that they may ſee
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:63179:116"/>
all thy nakedneſs.</hi> And to have the nakedneſs diſcovered is matter of ſhame.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Taking pleaſure in ſin cauſeth ſhame before <hi>our ſelves.</hi> Conſcience under guilt torments the Soul with the ſhame of its own folly. Hence that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.21. <hi>What fruit had you in thoſe things whereof ye are now aſhamed.</hi> Sin inticeth us before we commit it, and afterwards fills the Soul with horrour and ſhame. So our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, when they had ſinned, they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.7.</p>
               <p>But who was ever aſhamed of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and delights he found in the ways of godlineſs? A good man may be reproached and ſcoffed at for his ſtrictneſs, by the <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maels</hi> of the day; but there can be no cauſe of ſhame. For ſhame, as the Philoſopher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines it, is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
A certain grief and trouble in ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous minds about unbecoming actions, and ſuch things as tend to our infamy and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace; now there is nothing diſhonourable in Religion; it is only ſin that can diſcredit and defame us; where there is no ſin there is no ſhame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The pleaſures of ſin are prohibited pleaſures; they are forbidden fruit. If God hath forbid the doing of ſin, then much more the taking pleaſure in ſin. For it is a greater evil to take pleaſure in ſin than it is ſimply to act ſin; to delight in it is worſe than to do it. To do ſin may be only from weakneſs of grace; but to delight in ſin, is from the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:63179:116"/>
ſtrength of luſt. As it is a greater argument of grace to delight in obedience than to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey; for a man may be much in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of duties, that yet may have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in duty. But where there is a delight in duty and obedience, there the heart is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed under the power of grace. <hi>I delight to do thy will, O my God, thy Law is within my heart,</hi> Pſal. 40.8. So it ſpeaks the ſinner more under the power of ſin to delight in it than to do it: The more of the affection there is in ſin, the more ready will the ſinner be to comply with every temptation which leads to it. <hi>Amor animae pondus;</hi> and it is the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Satan to ſuit his baits to our corrupt appetites and vicious diſpoſitions, he loves to take the advantage of wind and tide, and when a man that delights in ſin is tempted to ſin, then he goes with wind and tide. Nay in this caſe a ſinner needs no temptation; his own vicious diſpoſition will ſupply the place of a Tempter; for the more any ſin obtains upon the affections, the more of the nature of a temptation doth it carry in it ſelf. <hi>Every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own luſt, and inticed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jam. 1.14.</note> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> he calls it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>his proper luſt,</hi> becauſe though we have all a corrupt nature in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, yet every ſinner hath a particular ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral inclination to this or that ſin rooted in his nature more than to any other; and this is called <hi>his own luſt.</hi> And how eaſily doth he conſent when he is inticed by his <hi>own luſt;</hi> he hath no power to reſiſt or withſtand; for the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:63179:117"/>
more a man delights in ſin, the more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally his deſires and vicious inclinations do run to it. And therefore God charges it as a high degree of ſinning, and makes it a great aggravation of ſin, to delight and take pleaſure in it. <hi>They have choſen their own ways,</hi> (that is, bad) <hi>and their ſoul delights in their abominations,</hi> (that is, worſe) <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66.3. And God aggravates the ſinfulneſs of Antichriſts followers by this, That <hi>they had pleaſure in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2.12. By all which the pleaſures of ſin appear to be forbidden pleaſures, ſo that no man can injoy any one luſt but he muſt reſolve to controul God, to violate his Authority, and break his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and <hi>he that breaks this hedge, a ſerpent will bite him,</hi> Eccleſ. 10.8.</p>
               <p>But where are we forbid to take pleaſure in Godlineſs? Are ſpiritual delights forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruit? May not a man rejoyce in God? O yes! For</p>
               <p n="1">1. This is ſo far from being forbidden as a ſin, that it is commanded as a duty. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light thy ſelf in the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 37.4. <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord always, and again I ſay rejoyce,</hi> Phil. 4.4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is the true Character of a godly man: <hi>His delight is in the law of the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 1.2. <hi>I will delight my ſelf in thy commandments which I have loved,</hi> Pſal. 119.47. <hi>I delight in the law of God after the inner man,</hi> Rom. 7.22. This no unregenerate man can attain to: <hi>Will he delight himſelf in the Almighty?</hi> ſays <hi>Job</hi> of the <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> Chap. 27.10. He may do
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:63179:117"/>
much, but this he cannot do. He may pray, and read, and hear, and make profeſſion of God; but he cannot delight in God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This makes us ſharers in the very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and joys of Saints and Angels in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; for the joy and pleaſure of that ſtate is in God and Holineſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This ſhall have a ſure reward. <hi>Delight thy ſelf in the Lord, and he ſhall give thee the deſires of thy heart,</hi> Pſal. 34.4. <hi>Thou ſhalt delight thy ſelf in the Lord—and I will feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father,</hi> Iſai. 58.14. Sometimes delight in God is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as a duty, but here it is promiſed as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. So that here is a double reward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to delighting in God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Such ſhall delight in God.</hi> They that make it their duty, it ſhall be their reward. As God ſometimes puniſhes ſin with ſin, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8.11. which is a great puniſhment; ſo he rewards delight in God with delight in God, which is a great reward. They ſhall find ſuch rich conſolations, ſuch abundant ſweetneſs and matter of ſatisfaction in God and his ways as ſhall fill the Soul with delight. <hi>Thy comforts delight my ſoul,</hi> Pſal. 94.19. <hi>They ſhall be abundantly ſatisfied with the fatneſs of thy houſe, and thou ſhalt make them drink of the river of thy pleaſures,</hi> Pſal. 36.8. That is one reward promiſed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>I will feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father.</hi> That is literally the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> given for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance to him and his ſeed; but this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:63179:118"/>
a Type of Heaven, therefore it is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious inheritance above that is chiefly intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So that theſe ſpiritual pleaſures ſhall have a ſure reward: And hence it appears, that though the pleaſures of ſin are forbidden fruit, yet the pleaſures of holineſs are not. They are lawful pleaſures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The pleaſures of ſin are dangerous pleaſures, full of danger. What <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays of the Harlot,<note place="margin">Iſai. 59.7.</note> 
                  <hi>Her houſe inclines to death, and her paths to the dead,</hi> Prov. 2.18. is true of every ſin; it is a way that takes hold of hell and death: Never any went on in it but have miſcarried. And what pleaſure can there be in a way ſo full of danger?</p>
               <p>But in the pleaſures of godlineſs there is no danger; no fear of miſcarrying: <hi>An high way ſhall be there, and it ſhall be called the way of holineſs, the way-faring men, though fools, ſhall not err therein,</hi> Iſai. 35.8. Where there is life without death, there muſt needs be pleaſure without danger; and ſo it is here, <hi>In the way of righteouſneſs is life,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 12.28.</note> 
                  <hi>and in the path<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way thereof there is no death.</hi> O what dangers do men run into for the pleaſures of ſin! dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of Soul and body, dangers of preſent judgment and eternal torment; but here is pleaſure without danger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> The pleaſures of ſin are diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed pleaſures; the ſmarting reflections and checks of Conſcience do greatly interrupt the free injoyment of ſins delights. There are but few ſinners but their pleaſures in ſin are attended with an upbraiding Conſcience.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:63179:118"/>
The beſt part of a natural man is his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; when will and affections are wholly for luſt, Conſcience many times takes part with God; when affections intice, conſcience troubles, and gives ſuch an amazing proſpect of the dreadful conſequences of ſin, as doth very much abate its pleaſures, and imbitter its ſweetneſs: Nay, many have been in great troubles and horrors for ſin upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; the gnawings of this worm within have been ſuch, as have utterly extinguiſhed the pleaſures of ſin for the preſent: Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence reflects guilt, guilt cauſes fear, and <hi>fear hath torment,</hi> 1 John 4.18. And in this caſe the pain of ſin is far more than the pleaſure; for no man can act with much pleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the checks of his own conſcience. And therefore many have been forced to find out ways to quiet conſcience, or at leaſt to ſilence its clamors, that they may have a more free and undiſturbed injoyment of their luſts; and this is that which hath made ſo many Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites both among Papiſts and Proteſtants, taking up a little outſide devotion, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling over a few prayers to God, and then thinking this a full amends to him for what is paſt, and ſo ſin upon a new ſcore. Luſt can't be freely injoyed unleſs conſcience is ſilent, conſcience will not be ſilent unleſs God be ſome way owned; and hence, though the ſinner in his heart hates God, and the life of God, yet he is forced to mingle ſomewhat of the practice of devotion with a vicious converſation, that he may at once injoy the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:63179:119"/>
ſweet of his luſts, and yet quiet a quarrelling conſcience. Or if cuſtom in ſin and a ſeared conſcience have worn out the ſenſe of ſuch checks and regrets, the caſe is ſo much the worſe: where-ever ſin is practiſed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience not pained, the man is dead; paſt life, and paſt hope. Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> relates of one in <hi>Cambridge</hi> that falling into a great ſin, his conſcience was troubled, but having this temptation upon him, That if he did the ſame ſin again, his conſcience would trouble him no more; he complied with the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ran into the ſame ſin again; after which his conſcience was ſilent, and from that time he went on in his luſts without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or controul.</p>
               <p>But the pleaſures of godlineſs are undiſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed pleaſures: <hi>Her ways are ways of pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and all her paths are peace,</hi> Prov. 3.17. The ſinner hath pleaſure but no peace, but in the ways of God the good man hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and peace. And it muſt needs be ſweet where <hi>pleaſure</hi> is attended with <hi>peace.</hi> There is a twofold peace that doth attend the life of godlineſs, peace <hi>ſupernal,</hi> and peace <hi>internal:</hi> The one is a peace between God and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: The other is a peace between conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and a mans ſelf. And where this peace is, the pleaſure of the Soul muſt needs be an uninterrupted pleaſure. <hi>Great peace have they that love thy Law, and nothing ſhall offend them,</hi> Pſal. 119.165.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> The pleaſures of ſin are diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pleaſures, and this ariſes from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:63179:119"/>
of one luſt to another. As all ſins are contrary to grace, ſo ſome ſins are repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and contrary one to another. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you read of ſerving <hi>divers</hi> or <hi>differing luſts,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,<note place="margin">Tit. 3.3.</note> and from the repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant commands of differing luſts the ſervice of ſin muſt needs fill the mind with diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for in gratifying one luſt the ſinner diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſes another; if he ſerves pride he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſes covetouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now in Religion there is nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. <hi>Virtutes ſunt inter ſe connexae,</hi> there is a delightful harmony and correſpondence among all the graces of the Spirit; he that acts one grace doth not contradict another, becauſe of the harmony that is between them; and this makes the pleaſure of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs greater than the pleaſure of ſin can be, becauſe it is a pleaſure without diſtraction. Indeed the mind may be, (and too often is) diſtracted from the efficacy of indwelling luſts; but not from any contrariety in the graces of the Spirit, for one duty forwards another, and helps another, and makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother the more eaſie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ninthly,</hi> The pleaſures of ſin are waſting and expenſive pleaſures; they waſte the ſtrength of the ſinner; <hi>And thou mourn at the laſt day when thy fleſh and thy body are conſumed, Prov.</hi> 5.11. They waſte the eſtate, ſin is a very chargeable thing; it cannot be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained without great coſt: Some mens luſts coſt them more in a day than their families do in a year; many a man ſtarves his wife
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:63179:120"/>
and children to feed his luſts; and many a wife robs her husband to gratifie her luſts; and by this means many a fair Eſtate hath been brought to a morſel of bread.</p>
               <p>But the pleaſures of godlineſs are not ſo; they neither waſte the ſtrength nor the eſtate. Not the ſtrength, for though <hi>the youth faint and be weary, and the young men utterly fail,</hi> yet <hi>they that wait upon the Lord ſhall renew their ſtrength, they ſhall run and not be weary, they ſhall walk and not faint,</hi> Iſai. 40.30, 31.</p>
               <p>Nor the eſtate, for though Religion calls for open-handedneſs, and honouring God with our ſubſtance; yet it calls but for a part, unleſs in extraordinary caſes; but luſt will have all: it is like the <hi>horſleech</hi> that always crys,<note place="margin">Prov. 30.15.</note> 
                  <hi>Give, give;</hi> it is never ſatisfied. One luſt is more chargeable to a ſinner to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, than all the graces of the Spirit are to a Believer. Godlineſs never waſted any man, but one luſt hath conſumed many, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and Body, and Soul, and all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tenthly,</hi> The pleaſures of ſin are confuted pleaſures. The Word of God confutes them, it calls them <hi>folly,</hi> Prov. 15.21. <hi>madneſs,</hi> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. 2.2. <hi>vexation of ſpirit,</hi> Eccleſ. 1.14. <hi>ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vanities,</hi> Jon. 2.8.</p>
               <p>Good men have confuted them; by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing and diſclaiming them, eſpouſing the worſt of Religion rather than the beſt of ſin: <hi>Chuſing rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God than to injoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon.</hi> Heb. 11.25.</p>
               <p>Wicked men have confuted them; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:63179:120"/>
upon a dying bed; ſometimes under convictions. Oh how have they cryed out then againſt the accurſed pleaſures of ſin; and of the folly and madneſs of their hearts for delighting in ſuch ſwiniſh luſts. <hi>Luther</hi> ſays, <hi>one drop of an evil conſcience ſwalloweth up a whole Sea of worldly joy</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>na gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tula malae conſcientiae totum mare mundani gaudii ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbet.</note>. So that the pleaſures of ſin have had many confutations.</p>
               <p>But whoever confuted the pleaſures of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs? The Word of God never did; no, that commends and ratifies them:<note place="margin">Prov. 3.17.</note> 
                  <hi>Her ways are ways of pleaſantneſs,</hi> Prov. 3.17. Good men never did; no, they juſtifie them, and that living and dying: <hi>Wiſdom is juſtified of her children,</hi> Mat. 11.19. The enemies of godlineſs never did, nor could; they may reproach and ſcoff at the ways of God, but confute them they cannot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eleventhly,</hi> The pleaſures of ſin are depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the creature: a man muſt keep up a communion with carnal objects to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them.</p>
               <p>But the pleaſures of godlineſs are indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; that is, as to the creature; the Soul need not be beholden to any creature what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to ſupport and feed them; they flow from God himſelf. In the pleaſures of ſin the creature lets out it ſelf, but in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of holineſs God lets out himſelf, and all the creatures in the world cannot let out ſo much ſweetneſs as God, nor ſuch kind of ſweetneſs as God doth. The creature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates but to ſenſe, but God communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates to the Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:63179:121"/>
                  <hi>Twelfthly,</hi> The pleaſures of ſin are unſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying pleaſures, and needs they muſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are unſuitable and diſproportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Soul, which is a Spirit; whereas the pleaſures of ſin are ſuited to ſenſe and fleſh. So that you may as ſoon make up a number with only cyphers, or make a meal of a ſhadow, as feed rational Spirits with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pleaſures.</p>
               <p>And this is the reaſon why the Soul makes ſuch frequent diverſions in its purſuit of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal delights, and goes from one pleaſure to another; it is not becauſe it is better, but becauſe it is new. Affectation of variety proceeds only from ſenſe of want, and is a confeſſion upon tryal that there is not in ſuch an injoyment what was expected.</p>
               <p>But the pleaſures of godlineſs are ſatisfying pleaſures, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.8. <hi>They ſhall be abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied with the fatneſs of thy houſe;</hi> how ſo? <hi>thou ſhalt make them drink of the river of thy pleaſures:</hi> and he that drinks of this river cannot but be ſatisfied, and ſatisfied abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly: <hi>He that drinks of the water I ſhall give him ſhall never thirſt more</hi>

Therefore fitly compared to <hi>the crackling of thorns under a pot,</hi> Eccleſ. 7.6. much noiſe, but little heat, and ſoon extinct. O what pleaſure did the rich man take in his abundance! but how long did it laſt? He reckoned upon <hi>many years;</hi> but it did not continue many hours. <hi>Thou fool, this night ſhall thy ſoul be required of thee, Luke</hi> 12.20.</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible that the pleaſure of ſin ſhould laſt long when the life of the ſinner is ſo ſhort. Indeed many times the ſinner out-lives all his joys and delights; they tarry not till he dies from them, but they die from him: ſometimes pining diſeaſes, ſometimes conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued croſſes, ſometimes a worm in the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence extinguiſh theſe joys, and they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver kindled more. But if none of theſe do, to be ſure death doth: for when that once comes, then farewel the pleaſures of ſin for ever. Hell is too hot a Climate for wanton delights to live in; ſin ſhall be ſo far from af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording delight there, that the remembrance of it ſhall greaten their torment. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the pleaſures of ſin do not die from us, yet we are ſure to die from them; as Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> ſaid to his Soul when expiring:
<q>
                     <pb n="218" facs="tcp:63179:122"/>
                     <l>Quae nunc abibis in loca?</l>
                     <l>Nec ut ſoles dabis jocos.</l>
                  </q>
Thou art now going where there is no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to be found.</p>
               <p>But now the pleaſure of godlineſs is dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pleaſure: it is not tranſient and fading. It is not water from a fading brook, but from a river whoſe ſprings fail not. Therefore the Holy Ghoſt had no ſooner ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt make them drink of the river of thy pleaſures, Pſal.</hi> 36.8. but he preſently adds in the next verſe, <hi>For with thee is the fountain of life.</hi> A fountain is always running, and yet is never exhauſted. The river of pleaſures which god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs affords, is fed from a fountain that is overflowing and ever flowing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourteenthly,</hi> The pleaſures of ſin have a ſad end. There is a ſting in the tail of them; they are like the wine <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of, that though it looketh pleaſantly in the cup, yet <hi>at the laſt it biteth like a ſerpent, and ſtingeth like an adder,</hi> Prov. 23.31, 32. The ſtollen waters of ſin (how ſweet ſoever they ſeem to be in the mouth) will be gall and wormwood in the belly, even bitterneſs in the latter end. So ſays <hi>Zophar,</hi> Job 20. 12, 13, 14. <hi>Though wickedneſs be ſweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue: Though he forſake it not, but keep it ſtill within his mouth, yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of aſps within him.</hi> O that ſinners would conſider the end of ſin. As <hi>Abner</hi> ſaid to <hi>Joab, Knowest thou not that it will be bitterneſs in the latter end?</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.26. Senſual pleaſure goes out like
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:63179:122"/>
a candle, and leaves a ſtink behind it; great damps and ſore griefs in the conſcience. <hi>Wo to you that laugh now, for ye ſhall mourn and weep,</hi> Luke 6.25. In <hi>Iſai.</hi> 5.14. it is ſaid, <hi>Hell hath inlarged her ſelf, and opened her mouth without meaſure, and he that rejoyceth ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into it:</hi> That is, he that lives in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſin, his preſent pleaſure ſhall end in Hell: where there is puniſhment without pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, miſery without mercy, ſorrow without ſuccour, miſchief without meaſure, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments without end. This is all you ſhall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver get by ſin; a little pleaſure and eternal torment.</p>
               <p>But the pleaſure of godlineſs as it is ſweet in the way, ſo it is ſweeter in the end. <hi>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace,</hi> Pſal. 37.37. Chriſt keeps the beſt wine till the laſt. The plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of godlineſs that good men injoy in the way, are not to be compared to the pleaſures that they ſhall injoy in the end. When the pleaſures of ſin ſhall end in the wrath of God and eternal miſery; the pleaſures of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall be ſo far from being extinguiſhed, that they ſhall be perfected<note n="*" place="margin">Si quid male feceri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

For holineſs brings us into the full fruition of God at laſt, <hi>In</hi> whoſe <hi>preſence is fulneſs of joy, and at whoſe right hand there are pleaſures for evermore,</hi> Pſal. 16.11. So that we may ſay of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of holineſs and the pleaſures of ſin, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays of wiſdom and folly, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Wiſdom excelleth folly as far as light excelleth darkneſs.</hi> So do the pleaſures of holineſs excel the pleaſures of ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:63179:123"/>And thus you have the pleaſure of Chriſts <hi>Yoke</hi> made out comparatively, <hi>viz.</hi> by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring it (1) with the <hi>Yoke</hi> of the Law, (2) with the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Sin.</p>
               <p>(3) I ſhall make it out by a collation of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. And I will inſtance in the moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult duties of Religion. If the moſt difficult and ſevere duties of Religion have a real plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs in them, then it muſt needs be good to come under the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt; but the moſt difficult duties of Religion have a real pleaſantneſs in them. I will inſtance in three which I take to be the moſt difficult.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Repentance.</item>
                  <item>Mortification of Sin.</item>
                  <item>Bearing the Croſs.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Repentance.</hi> This ſeems to be one of the moſt difficult and unpleaſant duties which the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt lays us under. It is an <hi>afflicting</hi> the Soul, <hi>Ezra</hi> 8.21. And what pleaſure can there be in <hi>affliction?</hi> It is a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>aſhamed and confounded</hi> for ſin, <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.22. And what pleaſure is there in <hi>ſhame</hi> and <hi>confuſion?</hi> It is a <hi>renting</hi> and <hi>breaking</hi> the heart, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.17. And what pleaſure can a man take to have his heart <hi>rent</hi> and <hi>broken?</hi> It is an exerciſing <hi>indignation</hi> and <hi>revenge</hi> upon our ſelves, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. And what pleaſure is it for a man to be <hi>angry</hi> with, and take <hi>revenge</hi> upon himſelf? It ſeems therefore upon all theſe accounts to be a very difficult duty; and yet notwithſtanding it is a duty full of pleaſure and ſweetneſs. And this will be manifeſt,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:63179:123"/>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> If you conſider it in its ſpring and riſe. The work of repentance, if it be right, hath for the ſpring of it the efficacy of the grace of the Goſpel upon the Soul, melting it down at the foot of God. The ſweet ſenſe of the goodneſs and mercy of God in Chriſt thaws the heart, and cauſes it to melt into tears of godly ſorrow for all ſin done againſt ſuch infinite love and tender bowels. <hi>That thou mayſt remember and be confounded—becauſe of thy ſhame when I am pacified towards thee for all that thou haſt done, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Ezek. 16.63. The reconciled face of God ſhining up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſinner makes him more aſhamed of ſin than any argument in the world can do. And there cannot but be pleaſure in the exerciſe of this grace when it flows from ſo ſweet a ſpring.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> If you conſider how great a hand it hath in removing the burden of ſin. Sin is ſuch a burden as will ſink the Soul down to Hell, if it be not removed. And if any man feel it not to be a burden, it is becauſe he is dead in ſin; but where there is any life, the burden is very great. <hi>Mine iniquities are gone over my head, as a burden they are too heavy for me,</hi> Pſal. 38.4. Now repentance helps to remove the burden of ſin; for when the Soul repents God forgives; and ſo the burden is took away. The pardon of ſin is that which takes away the burden of ſin: this <hi>Job</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates in that his expoſtulation with God, <hi>Job</hi> 7.20, 21. <hi>I am a burden to my ſelf, why dost thou not pardon my tranſgreſſion, and take
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:63179:124"/>
away mine iniquity?</hi> And there muſt needs be a ſweetneſs in that which eaſeth the Soul of ſuch a burden as ſin is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is that which renders all ſin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſible. Repentance and forgiveneſs always go together: true repentance ſhall ever find forgiveneſs; and this makes repentance very ſweet and pleaſant, in that it renders all ſin remiſſible. Where-ever the Lord gives a heart to repent, there he hath a heart to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. So that a Soul that doth unfeignedly repent of all ſin, may be aſſured of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of all ſin. Some call repentance a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a <hi>bitter-ſweet.</hi> It is a ſtormy voyage, but hath a rich return. At the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance it is like our Saviours draught of vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and gall; but the concluſion is like the end of <hi>Jonathans</hi> rod dipt in a honey-comb.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another duty is <hi>Mortification of Sin;</hi> and this ſeems a very difficult duty. And indeed to fleſh and blood it is ſo. What? to cut off the right hand, and pluck out the right eye? This is a hard ſaying. But yet to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Soul it hath real pleaſure and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in it. And needs it muſt, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider</p>
               <p>Firſt, The enmity that is between the <hi>new heart</hi> and <hi>fleſhly luſts.</hi> There is not a greater enmity and contrariety between any things in the world, than between theſe two. Light and darkneſs, Heaven and Hell are not more contrary. And from this contrariety of the Spirit to the fleſh, there is a conſtant luſting againſt it. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. <hi>The spirit</hi> (that is,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:63179:124"/>
the new nature) <hi>luſts against the fleſh.</hi> And what is this <hi>luſting?</hi> but a deſire and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſubdue and deſtroy luſt and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on within. Enmity delights in oppoſition. What greater pleaſure than to conquer and get the better of an enemy? The reaſon why the mortification of ſin is grievous, is becauſe of the friendſhip that is between the heart and luſt. Did we look on it as an enemy, (as it is the greateſt in the world) the ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it would be a pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If you conſider the miſchievous deſign that is carried on by ſin. And what is that? but to deſtroy the Soul. Nothing leſs can ſatisfie luſt than the life of the Soul. What is ſaid of the Harlot (<hi>Prov.</hi> 6.26.) that <hi>ſhe hunts for the precious life,</hi> is true of every luſt; which is therefore ſaid to <hi>war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the ſoul,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.11. againſt the <hi>grace</hi> of the Soul, againſt the <hi>comfort</hi> of the Soul, and againſt the <hi>life</hi> of the Soul. Therefore he that loves his Soul cannot but take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in mortifying of luſt, which hunts for the life of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is pleaſant as it eſtabliſhes a firm peace in the Conſcience. That is the trueſt pleaſure which miniſters moſt peace and quiet to Conſcience. He that gratifies luſt, offends againſt the quiet of Conſcience; but he that mortifies ſin, conſults its peace and comfort.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is pleaſant as a means to the end. Our eternal life depends upon the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying our luſts. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>If ye live after
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:63179:125"/>
the fleſh ye ſhall dye, but if ye through the ſpirit mortifie the deeds of the body ye ſhall live.</hi> No mortification no Salvation. If there be no cutting off <hi>right hand</hi> luſts, there can be no ſtanding at the <hi>right hand</hi> of Chriſt. Now we ſay, <hi>Finis dat amabilitatem mediis:</hi> The goodneſs of the end puts a lovelineſs into the means. How delightful then muſt the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of ſin be, whenas the life of the Soul is ſecured by it?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another difficulty is <hi>bearing the Croſs.</hi> Many can follow Chriſt till they come within ſight of the Croſs, but can go no farther. Like the ſtony ground Profeſſor, who <hi>endures for a while, but when perſecution ariſes becauſe of the word, by and by he is offended,</hi> Mat. 13.21. But where <hi>the kingdom of God</hi> is <hi>come with power</hi> into the heart, the Soul takes pleaſure in the very Croſs of Chriſt. <hi>I take pleaſure in infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, in reproaches, in neceſſities, in perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in diſtreſſes for Chriſts ſake,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.10. And it is ſaid of the Apoſtles (<hi>Acts</hi> 5.41.) <hi>They rejoyced that they were counted worthy to ſuffer ſhame for his name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus I have made it out to you that obedience to Chriſt is matter of real pleaſure, and that three ways, (1) poſitively, (2) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively, (3) by a collation of inſtances. I have inſtanced in the moſt difficult duties of Religion, and have made it out that there is a real pleaſure in them; and if in them, then in all. So that Religions worſt is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than ſins beſt; the worſt of Chriſts <hi>Yoke</hi> is eaſier than the eaſieſt of ſins bonds. As the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:63179:125"/>
Apoſtle ſays (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.25) <hi>The fooliſhneſs of God is wiſer than men, and the weakneſs of God is ſtronger than men;</hi> ſo the moſt unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant of Chriſts ways are more ſweet and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful than the moſt pleaſant of ſins ways can be; and therefore <hi>it is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.</hi>

                  <p>Some Objections against early Obedience an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NOW in the next place I ſhall endeavour to remove the ſtumbling blocks which Satan and a corrupt mind are wont to lay in the way of young ones, to hinder their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with this duty of taking up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt betimes; by anſwering ſuch objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as are uſually made againſt it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. The firſt ſtumbling block I ſhall name, and endeavour to remove, is about the unchangeable Decrees of God. Hath not God (ſay ſome) immutably fixed the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal condition of every man? Hath he not choſen ſuch as ſhall be ſaved, and paſſed by the reſt? And who can reſiſt his Will, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Counſels which have been from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting? If God hath elected me to eternal life, his purpoſes ſhall ſtand; they can never be diſannulled. My ſin can never fruſtrate Gods Election; and therefore my Salvation is ſure. And on the other hand, if God hath
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:63179:126"/>
ſhut me out of Heaven by the fatal Decree of his Preterition, all my duties and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours can never reach to reverſe the Decree. And therefore theſe arguments for taking up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt betimes are of little force, and to little purpoſe. Now in anſwer to this Objection I would ſay theſe five things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We are not to look to the <hi>Decree</hi> of God for a rule of life, but to the <hi>Word</hi> of God. It is not what his <hi>ſecret purpoſe</hi> is, ſo much as what his <hi>revealed Will</hi> is. <hi>Secret things belong to the Lord, but revealed things to us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this Law,</hi> Deut. 29.29. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree can neither be a rule of life, nor a ground of hope, but the Precept and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. So far as the Precept is our guide, the Promiſe will be our incouragement. He that ſins againſt the Goſpel, and rejects the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt, no Decree can ſave him; and he that gives up himſelf to conform in heart and life to the will and word of Chriſt, no Decree of God ſhall ever hurt him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though the Decree of God be as deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in other matters as in that of Salvation and Damnation, yet no man reſts upon that. God hath fixed the period of every mans life; <hi>His days are determined,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 14.5.</note> 
                  <hi>the number of his months is with thee, thou haſt appointed his bounds that he cannot paſs.</hi> Now will any man neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect his meals becauſe God hath determined his days? Will he ſay, If I eat and drink I ſhall live never the longer; if I never eat
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:63179:126"/>
more I ſhall not dye a day the ſooner? There is no man ſo bereft of ſenſe as to leave his life upon the decree of God without uſing means to preſerve it; for</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Decree is not only of the end, but alſo of the means. Faith and obedience are as much decreed by God as eternal life. Hence ye read of being <hi>choſen to ſalvation through ſanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13. And the Apoſtle to the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> ſays, <hi>God hath choſen us in him (viz.</hi> Chriſt) <hi>before the foundation of the world, that we ſhould be holy,</hi> Epheſ. 1.4. Holineſs is as much decreed as happineſs. There is no ſuch thing in all the Scripture as Election to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation ſeparate from faith and holineſs. The means and the end go together: the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is not made up only of promiſes for the incouragement of hope, but of directions for the furtherance of holineſs. And therefore</p>
               <p n="4">4. Though the Kingdom of Heaven be prepared by the Decree,<note place="margin">Matt. 29.34.</note> yet it muſt be ſought by an early diligence in duty. Though it is Gods good pleaſure to give it,<note place="margin">Luk. 12.32. Matt. 6.33.</note> yet it muſt be our work to ſeek it; though it be deſigned for us, yet it muſt <hi>ſuffer violence</hi> by us, and we muſt <hi>take it by force,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 11.12.</note> or we ſhall never injoy it, notwithſtanding Gods choice and Chriſts purchaſe. The land of <hi>Canaan</hi> (a type of Heaven) was a land of Promiſe, but yet they cannot poſſeſs upon the promiſe, without fighting their way to the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In the day of Judgment God will not
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:63179:127"/>
proceed with men upon Election and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, but upon their obedience or diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Law. <hi>He will render to every man according to his deeds. To them who by patient continuance in well-doing, ſeek for glory, and honour,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 2.7, 8.9.</note> 
                  <hi>and immortality, eternal life. But to them that are contentious and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteouſneſs; indignation and wrath.</hi> It is ſaid, <hi>God will judge the world in righteouſneſs,</hi> Acts 17.31. Now righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in judgment is to diſtribute to every one according to his works. God will vindicate the juſtice of his proceedings in that day by making the Word the rule of his Judgment to all that are under it, <hi>John</hi> 12.48. And every mans Conſcience a witneſs in the caſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15.</p>
               <p>Let no man therefore deceive himſelf by groundleſs concluſions about the ſecret De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of God, and ſo indulge himſelf in a ſinful neglect of duty to the eternal ruine of his Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. Another ſtumbling-block that lies in the way of young ones to hinder their taking up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt is this, That ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Religion ſeldom comes to any thing. They that mind Religion young, ſeldom hold out long. A young Saint and an old Devil<note n="*" place="margin">Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus juve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis ſenibus ſatanizat in annis.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The deſign of the Devil and wicked men in this Objection is to decry early holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; as if it were time enough to ſeek after God and grace when we are dropping into the grave. Now to ſuch I would ſay three things.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:63179:127"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This Objection is founded upon a notorious falſhood; for it ſuppoſes that true grace is utterly looſable; that a Child of God may periſh for ever; which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture doth expreſly conſute. Where the ſeed of God is once ſowed in the heart, it never dies; it is never loſt, nor plucked up; <hi>it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in him,</hi> 1 John 3.9. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>Train up a child in the way he ſhould go, and when he is old he will not depart from it,</hi> Prov. 22.6. So that this Proverb of <hi>a young Saint and an old Devil</hi> is none of <hi>Solomon's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is true, that where a profeſſion of Religion is taken up in Hypocriſie, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ends in Apoſtaſie. So that it may be ſaid, <hi>A young Hypocrite and an old Apostate.</hi> But where do you find that any that truly feared God did ever depart from him? <hi>Oba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diah</hi> feared the Lord <hi>from his youth:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Kings 18.12. 2 Kings 22.2.</note> and as he began with God, ſo he ended. <hi>Joſiah</hi> was good betimes; at eight years old; and he held it to the laſt: <hi>He turned not aſide to the right hand or to the left. David</hi> was a young Convert, and he died an old Saint.<note place="margin">Pſal. 71.5.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou art my hope, O Lord God, thou art my truſt from my youth,</hi> there is his beginning. <hi>My fleſh and my heart faileth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 73.26.</note> 
                  <hi>but God is the ſtrength of my heart and my portion for ever,</hi> there is his ending. I might inſtance in <hi>Samuel, Jeremy, John, Timothy,</hi> &amp;c. theſe began with God in their youth; took up the <hi>Yoke</hi> betimes; and ſo they continued all their days. He that chuſes God for his chief good and higheſt Lord at firſt, finds ſo much happineſs in him,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:63179:128"/>
that he will never leave him at laſt. Beſides, the Covenant of God is ſure, and one branch of it is, <hi>I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me,</hi> Jer. 32.40.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Should not the great uncertainty of life ſilence this Objection? We have no ſecurity for another day; much leſs that we ſhall live till the <hi>keepers of the houſe tremble, and the grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ceaſe, and they that look out of the windows be darkened,</hi> &amp;c. As <hi>Solomon</hi> elegantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes old age, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.3. Our candle may blow out as well as burn out; <hi>One dies in full ſtrength, being wholly at eaſe and quiet, his breaſts are full of milk, and his bones moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with marrow,</hi> Job 21.23, 24. And ſhall we be afraid of taking up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt too ſoon? Or ſuppoſe you ſhould live to old age, yet ſuch as turn their backs upon Chriſt while they are young, it is rare if ever they come to take up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt when they are old; as a young Saint will never leave Chriſt, ſo an old Sinner will hardly ever em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him.</p>
               <p>Or if he would, it may be too late; his ſeaſon of grace may be paſt. It is ſtoried of <hi>Hannibal,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> that when he could have taken <hi>Rome,</hi> he would not; and when he would have taken it, he could not. And is it not the caſe of many? When they may find Chriſt, they will not ſeek him; and when they would ſeek Chriſt, they cannot find him: when they may have mercy, they don't prize it; and when they would have mercy, they can't ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it. He that in his youth reckons it too
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:63179:128"/>
early to be converted, ſhall in old age find it is too late to be ſaved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 3. Another ſtumbling-block that lies in the way of young ones to hinder their taking up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt, is the auſterities of Religion; it is a work too ſevere for green years, and better ſuits gray hairs. Who doth not ſee what a melancholy thing Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is<note n="*" place="margin">Spiritus Calvinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholicus.</note>? it takes a man off from all his pleaſures and delights, and dulls and beſots the Spirits; and therefore when once a man takes up this courſe, never let him expect to ſee good day more. This is another ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſtone, which I ſhall endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move out of the way by theſe four Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Conſider who they are that charge Religion with theſe ſeverities. Are they ſuch as ever were under the power of it? Have they ever lived over its precepts, and embraced its promiſes, and taſted its ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes? Are they ſuch as can ſay they have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made any ſerious tryal of godlineſs? No, I know they are not; for if they had, they would paſs another judgment; their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences would confute a thouſand of theſe groundleſs pretences. No man ever took up Religion in earneſt, and heartily ſubmitted himſelf to the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt, but hath found it quite another thing. <hi>It is good for me to draw near to God,</hi> Pſal. 73.28.</p>
               <p>And if this be the charge of ſuch as never made a tryal what Religion and a holy life is, why ſhould any man regard it? For <hi>they ſpeak
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:63179:129"/>
evil of thoſe things they know not.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jud. v. 10. Prov. 24.7.</note> This <hi>wiſdom is too high for a fool;</hi> and they condemn it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do not underſtand it. And how unreaſonable is this? <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>He that anſwers a matter before he hears (i. e.</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands) <hi>it, it is folly and ſhame to him,</hi> Prov. 18.13. and yet in Religion nothing more common; who were they that in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles days accounted the doctrine of a <hi>crucified Chriſt fooliſhneſs?</hi> but ſuch as underſtood leaſt of it. And who are they that mock at the doctrine of <hi>imputed righteouſneſs,</hi> of the <hi>teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Spirit</hi> in Believers, and of <hi>aſſurance of Salvation,</hi> but the blind Papiſts who never felt the power and comfort of theſe things? And,<note place="margin">Tertul.</note> 
                  <hi>Quid inquius quàm ut oderint homines quod ignorant?</hi> Nothing more hateful than for a man to hate and condemn what he doth not underſtand. Therefore</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider what is the judgment of good men in the caſe, who have inured themſelves to a life of godlineſs; theſe are the fitteſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to determine the matter, <hi>having</hi> had <hi>their ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern between good and evil.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 5.14.</note> In other caſes you do ſo; if you want advice about matters of Law, you will go to an experienced <hi>Lawyer;</hi> or if you adviſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout your health, you will conſult the moſt experienced <hi>Phyſician.</hi> If you would be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied of ſuch or ſuch a Country, whom would you inquire of? ſuch as write at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of it, but never ſet foot in it? Or would you not rather take the judgment of ſuch as have ſeen it, lived in it, and known the Laws
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:63179:129"/>
and Manners of it? theſe can ſpeak by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and ſo can every ſincere profeſſor, <hi>John</hi> 3.11. <hi>We ſpeak that we know, and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that we have ſeen,</hi> and 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.3. <hi>That which we have heard, which we have ſeen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the word of life, declare we unto you.</hi> And what is their judgment in the caſe? why they have commended the life of Godlineſs as the moſt pleaſant and delightful life in the world, and the fulleſt of true joy and ſweetneſs. <hi>One day in thy Courts is better than a thouſand elſewhere,</hi> Pſal. 84.10. <hi>Her ways are ways of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are peace,</hi> Prov. 3.17. And how is <hi>Paul</hi> raviſhed with the joys of a life of Godlineſs; hence he ſpeaks his <hi>abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſolations by Chriſt,</hi> and crys out,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.4.</note> 
                  <hi>God forbid I ſhould glory ſave only in the Croſs of Chriſt,</hi> Galat. 6.14.<note place="margin">Gal. 6.14.</note> And this is not the ſenſe of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> only, but of all the Saints of God that ever lived; and they have not only ſaid it, but have practically atteſted it, and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably in this, that never any one of them when they once took up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt, ever caſt it off again, but have lived and died witneſſes to this truth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſorrows and dejections that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are at any time filled with, are not from Godlineſs, but from want of more God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; not from Grace, but from the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Grace; their ſins and failings are the only cauſes of their ſorrows and troubles.
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:63179:130"/>
Could they ſin leſs they ſhould have leſs ſorrow; and it is a moſt righteous thing that where ſin is committed it ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed. If no man can live without ſin, then how can it be that a man can love God and not mourn and ſorrow for ſinning againſt him? God will have every man living be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail and repent of ſin at one time or other; if not here, yet in hell. And then the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, which is beſt? here repentance ends in remiſſion, but in hell it ends in deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Sorrow for ſin now hath a bleſſing in it, it ends in comfort, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.5.6. But ſorrow for ſin hereafter greatens torment. This ſorrow will have an end, but <hi>that</hi> is without end. What are thoſe merry <hi>Greeks,</hi> that ſported away their time and their Souls in this world, doing now in hell? they are repenting without hope, and ſorrowing without end; <hi>weeping and wail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and gnaſhing of teeth</hi> at their own folly and madneſs. And which is beſt, (the ſinner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Judge) to go mourning to Heaven, where <hi>all tears ſhall be wiped away;</hi> or laughing to hell, where ſuffering and ſorrowing ſhall be without end?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Why ſhould a life of Religion be a dull and beſotting life? what is there in it that ſhould make it ſo? Doth it prohibit us any pleaſures or delights? no, none, but what are incompetent to us as men; and which make us rather beaſts than men. And for theſe it gives better pleaſures in their room: <hi>Peace that paſſes underſtanding,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Philip. 4.7.</note> inward ſatisfaction
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:63179:130"/>
reſulting from a witneſſing conſcience;<note place="margin">Prov. 14.14. 2 Corinth. 1.12.</note> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts that flow from an upper ſpring, from divine love manifeſted, and communion with God injoyed. Theſe are ſpiritual pleaſures and delights, of the ſame nature and kind with thoſe which in a fuller meaſure and greater degree of injoyment do make up the ſtate of bleſſedneſs. And hence it is called <hi>joy unſpeakable and full of glory.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.8.</note>
               </p>
               <p>So that your joys and delights are not <hi>extinguiſhed</hi> but <hi>raiſed:</hi> Religion doth not <hi>extirpate</hi> them, but <hi>tranſplant</hi> them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> that they may grow in <hi>Canaan.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſpiritualizeth and ſanctifieth your joys, but doth not extinguiſh them. So far then Religion is not chargeable with our droops and dulneſſes.</p>
               <p>Are they any of the precepts of Religion that cauſe this? that cannot be; for there is no duty God commands but what hath a certain and direct tendency to the comfort and happineſs of the creature. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>promiſes</hi> are not only ſaid to rejoyce the heart, but the <hi>precepts</hi> too. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.8. <hi>The ſtatutes of the Lord are right rejoycing the heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is it any Grace of the Spirit we are called to the exerciſe of, that is of a dejecting ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency? no, that cannot be neither, for Peace and Joy are the proper fruit of Grace,<note place="margin">Rom. 15.13.</note> 
                  <hi>filled with peace and joy in believing.</hi> The higheſt exerciſes of Grace bring forth the ſweeteſt Peace, and the richeſt Comfort, which is evident in this, that in Heaven where the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:63179:131"/>
Saints are in the higheſt exerciſe of Grace, there they injoy the moſt perfect comforts and delights. Therefore if Religion prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits no lawful delights; if its precepts im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe no beſotting ſervices; if it improves thoſe graces, the perfection whereof is attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with perfect joy and delight; then Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is no melancholy beſotting thing, there is nothing in it but what is deſirable and lovely; and therefore, whereas the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection ſays, farewel all good days when once young ones come to be Religious: I ſay, nay, the word of God ſays, they muſt never look to ſee good days till then. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10, 11. <hi>He that will love life and ſee good days,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 34.12.</note> 
                  <hi>let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they ſpeak no guile; let him eſchew evil and do good.</hi> Let no man therefore be diſcouraged from taking up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt upon this pretence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 4. Another prejudice that lieth in the way of young ones to hinder their taking up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt betimes, is the difficulty of it. The duties Religion binds upon us are an intolerable burden; its laws are very rigid, and its precepts uneaſie; it commands duty utterly contradictory to our affections and intereſts; to <hi>deny our ſelves,</hi> to <hi>love our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> to <hi>bleſs them that curſe us,</hi> to <hi>mortifie our members,</hi> to <hi>cut off our right hand,</hi> and <hi>pluck out our right eye,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 6.60.</note> &amp;c. <hi>Theſe are hard ſayings, who can hear them?</hi> difficult duties and who can perform them? who can enter in at this <hi>ſtrait gate,</hi> and walk in this <hi>narrow way</hi> without fainting?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:63179:131"/>Now I would obviate this Objection thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Either this is the way to Heaven and there is no other, or it is not. If it be not, then the Bible is a lye, and the whole of Religion is a grand cheat; and God in all his precepts and promiſes is the greateſt Impoſtor and Deceiver that ever the world knew. But who hath a forehead to aſſert this, which is the higheſt Blaſphemy that can be imagined?</p>
               <p>And if this be the way to Heaven, and there is no other; as moſt certain it is, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt himſelf the true and faithful wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs every where atteſts it, <hi>Matt.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Strait is the gate and narrow the way that leads to life.</hi> And verſ. 21. <hi>Not every one</hi> (not any one) <hi>that ſays to me, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doth the will of my father which is in heaven.</hi> Matt. 5.29, 30. <hi>If thy right eye offend thee pluck it out, if thy right hand offend thee cut it off, and caſt it from thee, for it is better for thee that one of thy members ſhould periſh than that thy whole body ſhould be caſt into hell.</hi> Matt. 16.24.<note place="margin">Matt. 16.24.25.</note> 
                  <hi>If any man will come after me, let him deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and take up his croſs and follow me; for whoſoever will ſave his life ſhall loſe it, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will loſe his life for my ſake ſhall find it.</hi> Matt. 18.3. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, except ye be converted and become as little children, ye ſhall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.</hi> Moſt evident it is by theſe and a hundred Scriptures more, that there is no other way to Heaven but this; and if ſo, then no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:63179:132"/>
ſhould deter us from it, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and great ſoever they be. We ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count no pains, no labour too much in ſo important a concern as this,<note place="margin">Luk. 10.42.</note> which is the <hi>one thing needful.</hi> Nay, difficulties in the ſervice of God ſhould rather excite than diſcourage; will ye ſerve God with that which coſt you nothing? conſider that though the <hi>gate</hi> be <hi>ſtrait,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 7.14.</note> and the <hi>way narrow,</hi> yet it <hi>leads to life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Hath not the ſervice of ſin its difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties too? yea greater than any that are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt? the commands of ſin are unreaſonable, brutiſh, full of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, and therein full of difficulty, and ſlavery, as I have ſaid; and therefore the carnal ſinner is in this ſelf condemned, in that he objects the difficulties of Religion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to keep off the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt, and yet at the ſame time yields a willing obedience to his luſts notwithſtanding all the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that attend them, which are as great or greater than thoſe of Religion can be.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe that Religion doth call a man to part with all, as ſometimes it doth: doth not luſt do the ſame?<note place="margin">

                  </note> and where one man hath ſacrificed his all to Religion, many have ſacrificed their all to their luſts. How many have drunkenneſs and gluttony un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done? how many have been brought to beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery by pride and exceſs? how many have been brought to <hi>a morſel of bread</hi> by the <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh woman?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 6.26.</note> Beſides, whatever a man lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for God and Religion, God hath enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:63179:132"/>
to make it up again, <hi>Matt.</hi> 19.29. But if a man waſts all upon the ſervice of his luſts, who makes up that again? there is none to make up his loſs, but the waſt will make guilt great, and his account grievous.</p>
               <p>It may be you account it hard that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and the ſervice of God require ſo much of your time; and doth not the world and luſt require as much of their followers, and that for meer dreams and ſhadows? and why ſhould it be more burdenſome to live to God than to the Fleſh? or to ſpend time in ſeeking and ſerving God for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal bleſſedneſs, than in ſeeking and ſerving the world for empty vanities, which either we cannot get; or if we do, we cannot keep?</p>
               <p>Doth Religion at any time expoſe a man to ſufferings, to corporal pains, and death? So doth luſt much more. O how great are the pains of <hi>Hatred!</hi> the torments of <hi>Envy!</hi> that one luſt of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs;</hi> what pains and miſeries hath it expoſed men unto, and where one dies a Martyr for Chriſt, thouſands dye Martyrs to their luſts, having their days ſhortened by exceſs in ſin, beſides the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs torments that follow after. So that they who complain of the difficulties of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, find greater in the way of their luſts; and therefore are ſelf-condemned in that they ſerve them without complaining.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The difficulties of Religion do not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from the nature of the Precept, but from the indiſpoſition of the ſubject. It is the fleſh that makes the commandment
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:63179:133"/>
grievous. This indiſpoſition of the Subject may be conſidered two ways.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) As it is in its full ſtrength and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy. And thus it is in all unregenerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whereby every command of God is a burden. <hi>The carnal mind is enmity againſt God, for it is not ſubject to the law of God, nor indeed can be,</hi> Rom. 8.7.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) As being in part cured and taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by a ſaving principle and habit of Grace wrought in the heart. And thus it is in all ſuch as are converted to God; ſo that the power of Sin is in part broken, and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Grace in part ſet up: and hence the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is acted by contrary principles; there is the <hi>new man</hi> and the <hi>old,</hi> the <hi>fleſh</hi> and the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> the <hi>regenerate part</hi> and the <hi>unregenerate:</hi> and theſe are the <hi>two armies in the Shulamite</hi> which ye read of, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.13. That is, the fleſh with its luſts, and the ſpirit with its Graces oppoſing one another in the whole of a Chriſtians obedience. There is <hi>a will</hi> and <hi>a will not;</hi> a <hi>delight</hi> and a <hi>regret</hi> in the ſame perſon about the ſame precept. So far as Grace is wrought, duty is eaſie; ſo far as Sin remains and interpoſes, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is a burden. Were ſin fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed out of our natures and grace perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there would be no difficulty in any duty; no burden in obedience, becauſe there would be an univerſal and compleat ſuitableneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the heart and the work, as there is in Heaven between the will of a Saint and the will of God; ſo that it is remaining luſt
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:63179:133"/>
that makes duty difficult. Labour therefore to ſhake off ſin, and beg of God to write his Law in your hearts, and then nothing in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion will be difficult.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 5. Another ſtone of ſtumbling to hinder young Ones from taking up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt, is the ſcoffs and ſcorns that attend it. The ſerious profeſſors of Chriſtianity are <hi>a ſect every where ſpoken againſt,</hi> Acts 28.22. One while they are <hi>Puritans</hi> and <hi>Preciſians,</hi> another while <hi>Sectaries</hi> and <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while <hi>Fanaticks</hi> and <hi>Whiggs;</hi> varying the phraſe according to the mode of the times. And who can endure to be made the ſcoff and jeer of the age? by reaſon of this many are aſhamed of Chriſt and his <hi>Yoke.</hi> Now to remove this ſtumbling ſtone, I would have theſe eight things ſeriouſly conſidered.</p>
               <p>

He burdens Religion with ſcandals and prejudices, and ſo makes many hate and decry it, who would otherwiſe ſee a Beauty in it and imbrace it. This is the preſent deſign the Devil is driving on.

Not becauſe the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going days were free from this evil, for they have been in all ages (as I ſaid before.) But the laſt days ſhall be more infeſted with them; that is,</p>

not well enough catechiſed to make an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.

And therefore <hi>as brute beaſts, made to be taken and destroyed, they ſpeak evil of the things they underſtand not, and ſhall utterly periſh in their own corruption,</hi> 2. Pet. 2.12.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſider why they ſcoff at Religion, and at them who profeſs and practiſe it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Why do they ſcoff at Religion? but becauſe it would reſtrain their luſts, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct their ſinful courſe which they are bent upon. And therefore they diſcountenance Religion that they may the better counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance their luſts. <hi>There ſhall come in the laſt days ſcoffers, walking after their own luſts,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.3. mark, it is for the ſake of their luſts that Religion is ſcorned and hated. It is from an evil life that any man reproaches Godlineſs; <hi>they hate the light, and come not to it, leſt their deeds ſhould be reproved,</hi> John 3.20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Why do they ſcoff at them that profeſs and own Religion? but becauſe they will not be Beaſts, nor offer violence to their Reaſon, nor ſtifle the convictions of their own Conſciences, nor reſiſt the ſpirit, nor put off the Image of God, and become as Devils. They mock at them for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king God for their chief good; for ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his love and favour; for minding and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:63179:136"/>
to ſave an immortal Soul; for labouring to avoid the wrath of God and the miſeries of Hell, and to ſecure an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happineſs. For this is the great work and buſineſs of Religion; the <hi>Object</hi> of it is God in Chriſt; the <hi>Rule</hi> of it is the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures; the <hi>End</hi> of it is the Glory of God in our own Salvation: and the whole <hi>work and buſineſs</hi> of it is to dye to ſin, to live to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; to walk after the ſpirit, and not to fulfill the luſts of the fleſh. <hi>To deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world,</hi> Tit. 2.12. This is the ſure way to that bleſſed end; <hi>ye have your fruit unto holineſs, and the end everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life,</hi> Rom. 6.22.</p>
               <p>This is the ſumm of the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; and what is here to be ridiculed and made mockery? they that will ſcoff at men for being Religious, may as well ſcoff at the <hi>Seaman</hi> for uſing a <hi>Pilot</hi> to keep the Ship from Rocks and Sands; or at the <hi>blind man</hi> for walking with a <hi>guide,</hi> that he may not fall into the Pit; or at the <hi>ſick man</hi> for ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Cure</hi> when his life is in danger. They ſcoff at you for keeping the promiſe they have broken, and for endeavouring to make good the baptiſmal Covenant which they have violated. They have promiſed to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the world, to forſake the Devil and all his works, to abandon the luſts of the fleſh,</hi> but have not done it, but are Covenant-breakers; and becauſe you labour to be true to your Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, therefore they mock and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:63179:136"/>
ſcoff; ſo that the true reaſon of all is becauſe you are not as vile as they, as falſe to God and to your ingagement, <hi>they think it ſtrange that you run not with them to the ſame exceſs of riot, ſpeaking evil of you,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.4. and is not this moſt irrational and worſe than bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh? and why ſhould you ceaſe to act like ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional creatures, becauſe others act below the Brutes?</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is not you but God whom they hate and ſcorn; it is his name and honour they wound through your ſides; and therefore the Apoſtle calls the reproach of Chriſtians <hi>Chriſts reproach,</hi> Heb. 13.13. For whoever ſcoffs at any man for that of God that is in him, ſcoffs not at man ſo much as at God. Were you a ſwiniſh Drunkard, an unclean Brute, a proud Huff, an hectoring Atheiſt, a Dam-mee like themſelves, they would hug and imbrace you: ſo that the hatred and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is evidently againſt the Image and Life of God in you, and therefore againſt God himſelf. <hi>If ye were of the world, the world would love his own, but becauſe ye are not of the world, but I have choſen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you,</hi> John 15.19. Now if the holy God (who is able to frown the proudeſt ſinner into Hell in a moment) is patient and long ſuffering towards theſe, and bears all their ſcoffs, and hard ſpeeches, and indignities: why ſhould you think much to bear them? eſpecially when it is for his name ſake. <hi>All theſe things will they do unto you for my name ſake,</hi> John 15.21.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:63179:137"/>6. Set the reſpect of God againſt the ſcorns of the World. What though the World hates, ſo long as God loves? let them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach thee, yet the holy God honours thee. <hi>If any man ſerve me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam 2.30.</note> 
                  <hi>him will my father honour,</hi> John 12.26. <hi>He is not aſhamed to be called your God,</hi> Heb. 11.16. and if ſo, why ſhould you be aſhamed to be called his People? He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of you as <hi>the excellent of the Earth;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 16.3.</note> and therefore you ſhould ſet that againſt the mocks and ſcoffs of wicked men. <hi>Aliud ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicium hominis, aliud judicium Dei;</hi> whoſe judgment is moſt to be eſteemed, the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Gods,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.2.</note> 
                  <hi>which is always according to truth;</hi> or unrighteous mans which is blinded with prejudice and hatred of God and all his ways and People? and therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> flights the cenſures of men, and values him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wholly upon the approbation of God; <hi>With me it is a very ſmall thing, that I ſhould be judged of mans judgment, — but be that judgeth me is the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.3, 4.</p>

ANother ſtumbling block that hinders young Ones from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt, is the diverſity of opinions, and the many differences which are found among the profeſſors of Religion. I would take up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt if I knew which was the right way. But how ſhall I that am young be able to judge? one is for this way, another is for that; one ſays, <hi>lo here is Chriſt,</hi> another ſays, <hi>lo he is there;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 24.23.</note> and Chriſt ſays, <hi>believe them not.</hi> One pleads for this Doctrine, another for that, a third denys both. One is for this way of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, another for that, another is neither for this nor that, but above all. So that I ſee whom to avoid, but I ſee not whom to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Therefore till Profeſſors are agreed, it is better to be of no ſide.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:63179:138"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I confeſs it is a great advantage which Satan takes to prejudice young ones againſt Religion, by the differences that are among the profeſſors of Religion. But I would have ſuch conſider five things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A man may with as much reaſon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the light of the Sun, becauſe the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als differ about the time of the Day, as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim Religion becauſe of mens differing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions about it. What is it in this World that men differ not about? all men differ in their reaſonings; ſhall I therefore abandon my reaſon and become a brute? all mens fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces differ; ſhall I therefore renounce huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, becauſe all are not of one complexion? all mens appetites and palates differ; ſhall I therefore refuſe my meat till all palates re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh one thing? becauſe men differ in their faſhions; ſhall I therefore caſt off the uſe of rayment till all come to the ſame garb? how fooliſh and abſurd is this! and is it not the ſame, becauſe ſome men differ in ſome things of Religion, therefore to caſt off all Religion?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Is this any new thing? hath it not been ſo in all ages of the Church? if therefore Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion had been diſclaimed till the minds of all men had been united in the profeſſion of it, it had long ere this been ſhut out of the World. The Scripture tells you, <hi>there muſt be hereſies,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.19. it doth not ſay on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there <hi>will be</hi> hereſies, importing the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of them; but <hi>there muſt be hereſies,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the neceſſity of them: And we
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:63179:138"/>
have a double reaſon render'd for this in the Word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, That they which are approved may be made manifeſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.19. they are the touchſtone of ſincerity. God loves to try the ſincerity of his Peoples Graces, this being the glory of every Chriſtian, and a diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on highly pleaſing to God. Were there but one opinion in matters of Faith, one way of Worſhip among all Chriſtians, to owne this would be no great matter; but to owne and cleave to the truths of God againſt all the errours that oppoſe them, to ſtick to the pure Worſhip of God againſt all the humane Deviſings and Antichriſtian Impoſitions of men: this ſhews the power of faith, the zeal of love, the greatneſs of ſelf-denial, and the uprightneſs of the heart in all. As the Stars ſhine brighteſt in the darkeſt night, ſo do the Graces of the Saints (who are the <hi>lights of the world</hi>) appear in their greateſt luſtre under the darkneſs of falſe Worſhip and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. That is one reaſon why <hi>there muſt be hereſies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another is this, for the detecting and inſnaring of falſe hearted hypocrites. Hereby unſound Profeſſors are diſcovered; errour and hereſie have a great hand in dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting hypocriſie. This is a time of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which they fall away.<note place="margin">Matt. 13.</note> So did they 1 <hi>John.</hi> 2.19. <hi>They went out from us</hi> (there's the diſcovery) <hi>but they were not of us</hi> (there's their hypocriſie) <hi>for if they had been of us they would no doubt have continued with us, but they
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:63179:139"/>
went out that they might be made manifeſt that they were not all of us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as errours and hereſies ſerve to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unſound profeſſors, ſo alſo to inſnare and deſtroy them; for there are damning opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as well as damning practices. When men of bad lives and worſe hearts grow wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the power of truth, God ſuffers corrupt Doctrines to ſpring up that may gratifie their luſts, and ſuit their vicious inclinations, and in a fond compliance herewith, truth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, luſt thrives, and the ſoul periſhes. This is the very reaſon rendered why God at the firſt appearing of Antichriſt in the World, gave men up to his damning deluſions; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they received not the love of the truth that they might be ſaved, for this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſion, that they ſhould believe a lye, that they all may be damned who have not believed the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2. 10; 11, 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Conſider from whence theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences do ariſe; not from Religion it ſelf, which is in all matters of faith and practice di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and certain; the rule which is the word of God is the ſame to all, and gives perfect di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to guide us to life and bleſſedneſs. <hi>The law of the Lord is perfect converting the ſoul, the teſtimony of the Lord is ſure making wiſe the ſimple, the ſtatutes of the Lord are right rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the heart,</hi> Pſal. 19.7, 8. And therefore the differences that are found among the profeſſors of Religion, are either from the different meaſures of knowledge to which
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:63179:139"/>
Chriſtians have attained, or from their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent capacities; or elſe (which is worſe) from the Pride and Luſts of ſome of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, that will dare to be wiſe above what is written, ſetting their poſts by Gods poſts, and teaching for Doctrine the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men: would men but allow Chriſt to be head of the Church, and ſole Lord of Conſcience, and receive the word at his mouth, and ſtoop to his Authority, and not ſet up their wills and inventions for a rule of Worſhip, the moſt of our differences would be at an end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> All differences in Religion are not inconſiſtent with Salvation; indeed errours in the fundamental Principles of Godlineſs are damning; and therefore all ſincere Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſhall be kept from falling into ſuch er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; they have received the ſpirit of truth to guide them into all truth neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;<note place="margin">John 16.13.</note> but it is poſſible that good men may fall into many errours; you read of ſome that <hi>hold the foundation,</hi> who yet <hi>build wood, and hay, and stubble</hi> upon it; yet theſe <hi>ſhall be ſaved</hi> as holding the foundation, though <hi>their works ſhall be burned,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.12, 15.</p>
               <p>There are many that were of differing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions when here on Earth, who are all of one mind now in Heaven. Therefore he that condemns Religion becauſe of the differences of them that fear God, ſhall be condemned to Hell as abiding in the eſtate of them that fear him not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> If differences in Religion be the cauſe
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:63179:140"/>
why you owne not Religion; then why do you not owne it ſo far as all good men are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in it? though there is difference in ſome things, yet there are many (and they the greateſt) things wherein they are all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed. All are agreed that <hi>he that believes not, ſhall be damned;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mark 16.16.</note> and why then do you not cloſe with Jeſus Chriſt? all are agreed that without ſincere repentance, and a ſound con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion there can be no Salvation; why then do ye not ſhake off your luſts, and turn from ſin to God? all are agreed of the neceſſity of <hi>fearing God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12.13. Tit. 2.12. Heb. 12.14.</note> 
                  <hi>and keeping his Commandments,</hi> of living <hi>ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world;</hi> and that <hi>without holineſs no man ſhall ever ſee the Lord;</hi> and therefore why are not theſe things practiſed which have an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal conſent? if ſome leſſer matters are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted doubtful and diſputable, yet theſe are things without all controverſie. Sin muſt be forſaken, ſelf muſt be denyed, luſt muſt be mortified, the world muſt be renounced, Chriſt muſt be your King and Lord, he muſt have his throne in your hearts, his commands muſt be obeyed, or you can never be ſaved. This is the plain way to Heaven, and there is no other but what runs into this. And to this you have the conſent of all good men that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Now if differing opinions about leſſer mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have kept you off from medling with them; why ſhould not univerſal conſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage you to mind theſe great and neceſſary things, whereon your Peace, your Life, your
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:63179:140"/>
Souls, your Eternal Salvation and Happineſs do depend? eſpecially conſidering this, that if you neglect the great things of Salvation,<note place="margin">Heb. 2.3.</note> you can never hope to eſcape, nor find ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the wrath of God under ſo vain a plea as the differences about Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 7. Another thing that hinders young ones from taking up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt, is the eaſineſs of repenting and turning to God hereafter. God is full of mercy and will not refuſe or reject a penitent ſinner at any time, no though at the laſt hour; witneſs <hi>the thief upon the croſs;</hi> how little time had he for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and yet he obtained mercy; and why may not I?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This <hi>Thief</hi> may in a ſenſe, be ſaid to be a greater thief dead than living. The example of his repentance and converſion in a dying hour hath ſtole away many a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, many a ſeaſon of grace, many a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, nay many a Soul, which hath taken incouragement from his late converſion to put off the great buſineſs of Salvation to the laſt.</p>
               <p>Now to prevent this undoing and Soul-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying miſchief, I would ſay ſix things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this example.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This is an example without a parallel, and therefore not to be urged in this caſe. God did this once (as one ſays) that none might deſpair, and but once that none might preſume. You have not ſuch another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in all the Scripture, which is a ſtory of five thouſand Years, and yet in all that
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:63179:141"/>
time we have but one inſtance of a man that repented when he came to dye; and will any man dare to adventure his Soul upon ſuch an inſtance as that? you read <hi>Acts</hi> 27.44. that the Ship wherein <hi>Paul</hi> failed was ran aground, and yet not one man loſt; <hi>ſome by ſwimming, and ſome on boards, and ſome on broken pieces of the Ship, they all eſcaped ſafe to land.</hi> Now would not that man be accounted a mad man that ſhould run his Veſſel a ground upon the incouragement of this ſucceſs?</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a pattern without a precept. Where is any command that incourages the dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our youth to ſin and luſt, and our old age to repentance? is there any precept of God that indulges to a youthful remisneſs in the great buſineſs of Religion? no not one, but the quite contrary. I dare not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but God may be found in the laſt hour, but no man ought therefore to put off ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him till then; becauſe the rule is, <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thy Creator in the days of thy youth, before the evil days come, and the years draw nigh when thou ſhalt ſay I have no pleaſure in them,</hi> Ec. 12.1.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is a precedent without a promiſe, ſhew me one promiſe that ever God made to accept ſuch a repentance as this. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a very hopeleſs attempt, nay a down-right preſumption, to expect mercy without a promiſe of mercy, or in a way not promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, is preſumption.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It was a miraculous work upon a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar reaſon; to wit, to <hi>ſhew forth</hi> his <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> even when his humane nature was dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:63179:141"/>
There was never ſuch a concurrence of works of wonder in any age of the world as at that time; the Sun loſing his light; the Air darkened; the Earth quaking; the Rocks rent; the Graves opened; many Dead raiſed; and among the reſt this was one, a <hi>Thief,</hi> while hanging upon the Croſs conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; this was to manifeſt his deity under his greateſt ſuffering, and to take away the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny of his croſs: ſo that we may (as one ſays) almoſt as well expect a ſecond crucifying of Chriſt, as a ſecond converſion of this nature.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Was there not another <hi>Thief</hi> at the ſame time upon the Croſs? and yet he repented not, though he had much means to help him in the work; his fellow recanting of his ſin, becoming a true convert, reproving his ſin, calling him to repent, owning the Lord Chriſt, praying for mercy; yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this he repented not, but as he lived ſo he dyed, in his ſins and luſts. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou haſt greater cauſe to fear being caſt off with the impenitent <hi>Thief,</hi> than to be received to mercy with this ſignal Convert; eſpecially conſidering, that there is but this one inſtance in all the Bible, and for this one that was received to mercy, thouſands and thouſands have been caſt off.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This <hi>Thief</hi> upon the Croſs is an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple pleaded but not imitated; and ſo we make that a dangerous temptation, which would otherwiſe be an incouraging inſtance. You that urge this for an example, do but imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate it, and then you'l make a right uſe
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:63179:142"/>
of it. For we don't find that this <hi>Thief</hi> was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver called to believe till then; and therefore ſo ſoon as he heard of Chriſt he believes in him, and ventures his Soul upon his righteouſneſs. And God requires no more than that we would anſwer his call, and accept the firſt tenders of Grace. If God calls when it is late, he will accept late converſion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt takes that for an anſwer in <hi>Matt.</hi> 20.<note place="margin">Matt. 20.6.</note> when he asks them, <hi>why ſtand ye here all the day idle?</hi> and they anſwer, <hi>becauſe no man hath hired us;</hi> but as ſoon as he calls, they come. Do you come in and believe in Chriſt at the firſt call, as the <hi>Thief</hi> here did? if God calls not till the eleventh hour, he that comes in at the eleventh hour comes in good time; but he that is called at the firſt or third hour, may come too late if he puts it off till the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth: if thou dareſt ſinfully ſay, it is too ſoon to day, it may be God may judicially ſay, it is too late to morrow.</p>
               <p>And therefore this inſtance of the <hi>Thief</hi> on the Croſs is moſt ignorantly and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently urged, which doth no way reach the caſe of impenitent ſinners under Goſpel Grace, and the daily and loud calls of God. The <hi>Thief</hi> never put off the work of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and converſion (that we find) to the laſt hour; this thou doſt. The <hi>Thief</hi> never purpoſed to repent hereafter, that he might thereby the better enjoy his luſts at preſent; this thou doſt. The <hi>Thief</hi> came into Chriſt at the firſt call; but thou haſt been often called and yet haſt refuſed to come, and
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:63179:142"/>
therefore what is this inſtance to thee? it doth not at all concern thy caſe, it is falſly urged and vainly pleaded. And therefore inſtead of incouraging thy ſelf from this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle inſtance of the <hi>Thiefs</hi> being at laſt hour received to mercy, thou ſhouldſt conſider and tremble at that dreadful threatning of God againſt ſuch as ſlight and ſtand out againſt the calls and offers of mercy, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. from the 24. verſe to the laſt. <hi>Becauſe I have called and ye refuſed, I have ſtretched out my hand and no man regarded; but ye have ſet at nought all my counſel, and would none of my reproof; I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo will laugh at your calamity, I will mock when your fear cometh.</hi> And verſ. 28. <hi>They ſhall call upon me but I will not anſwer, they ſhall ſeek me early but they ſhall not find me.</hi> And verſ. 32. <hi>The turning away of the ſimple ſhall ſlay them;</hi> that is, their turning away from the calls of God and offers of Grace, will be their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation at the laſt. And therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this, it is ſeldome (if ever) that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny adventure ſo near the brink of Hell, as to put off repentance and cloſing with Chriſt to the laſt hour, thinking to come off ſafe, but that they drop in at the laſt.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein the reaſons of ſlighting Christ are inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into, and the evil of it aggravated.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>USE of reproof</hi> to ſuch as delay and put off the putting on Chriſts <hi>Yoke.</hi> O what folly is this! and yet there is nothing more natural. Few there are that do downright re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe Chriſt, but many there are that put him off till hereafter; from one time to another, from childhood to youth, from youth to manhood, from manhood to old age, from old age to the death bed, till there is no room left for this great work. They while away one ſeaſon after another, till the ſeaſon of Grace is paſt and gone.</p>
               <p>In the managing this uſe I will do three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Inquire into the cauſes why men deal thus with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Charge the ſinner with ſuch aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this evil as may ſet home the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Propound ſome Conſiderations for a thorough conviction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Let us inquire into the cauſes why men deal thus with Chriſt; whence is it that any do refuſe his <hi>Yoke?</hi> break his bonds and caſt his cords from him.</p>
               <p>It may be reduced to theſe five heads chiefly.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Ignorance: This is one cauſe of all
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:63179:143"/>
the ſlights that are put upon Chriſt; this our Lord Chriſt intimates in that paſſage to the <hi>Samaritan</hi> woman, <hi>John</hi> 4.10. <hi>If thou knew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the gift of God.</hi> A Soul that hath a right knowledge of Chriſt, cannot but owne him and bow to him. <hi>They that know thy name will truſt in thee,</hi> Pſal. 9.10. Knowledge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets love, and love begets obedience. If you did but know Chriſt, his undertakings for you, his relation to you, his dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you, you would not thus reject his <hi>Yoke</hi> and deſpiſe his Command. It is your blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is the reaſon of your diſobedience. <hi>What is thy beloved more than another beloved?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cant. 5.9.</note> In 1 Cor. 2.8. the Apoſtle charges all their contemptuous carriage to Chriſt upon their ignorance; <hi>whom none of the Princes of this world knew, for had they known it, they would not have crucifyed the Lord of glory.</hi> Did you know Chriſt, you would not refuſe his call, nor reject his <hi>Yoke.</hi> Oh how many that are accounted men of underſtanding and parts, and eſteemed the wits of the age, yet are groſly ignorant of the myſtery of Chriſt and the Goſpel, and ſo,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.22.</note> 
                  <hi>profeſſing themſelves wiſe they become fools. The God of this world hath blinded their minds, left the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, who is the Image of God ſhould ſhine into them,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.4.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is from that root of unbelief that grows in every carnal heart; men don't believe the things of the inviſible world, the Glory to be revealed or the Miſery threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the neceſſity of Faith and Holineſs
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:63179:144"/>
for the ſecuring the one and avoiding the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that is the reaſon. The Apoſtle ſays,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.7.</note> 
                  <hi>we walk by faith and not by ſight;</hi> but the generality of men walk by ſight not by faith, their hearts are fixed upon preſent things,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.9.</note> they <hi>cannot ſee afar off.</hi> Did men believe that ſinful pleaſures will end in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal torments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the luſts of the fleſh can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be indulged at any eaſier rate than the loſs of the Soul; that there is no relief from the bondage and burden of ſin but by a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; and that he is a Saviour to none whom he does not rule,<note place="margin">Heb. 5.9.</note> to none but <hi>them that obey him;</hi> you would hearken to his call, and come under his <hi>Yoke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 17.14. 2 Tim. 4.10.</note>Moſt men are men of this world, as <hi>David</hi> calls them, they are for a portion in this life; <hi>Demas hath imbraced this preſent world;</hi> and there is no greater token of a carnal unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart, than for a man to fix upon a preſent happineſs, when God hath propounded an eternal felicity in another world. The good man is for the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt here, and a Crown hereafter; the unbeliever is for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent eaſe and ſatisfaction, and therefore takes up with the <hi>pleaſures of ſin that are but for a ſeaſon.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11.25.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It is from that general unconcernedneſs that is in men about the matters of the world to come.<note place="margin">Amos. 6.3.</note> They put <hi>far from them the evil day;</hi> and things at a diſtance don't affect us; they are like the diſcharging a gun a great way off, we hear the report without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernedneſs, but the ſame ſet to our breaſts
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:63179:144"/>
and diſcharg'd, would make us tremble. A clap of thunder in a remote part of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens doth not ſtartle us ſo much as when it is juſt over our heads.</p>
               <p>Next to the want of a ſound belief, the want of a ſerious conſideration, is the great cauſe why men dally with God. For as Faith makes inviſible things evident,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.1.</note> and future things preſent, ſo conſideration makes them great, and gives them their due weight. Conſideration is an intimate view of things; it ponders matters fully, their natures, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, and tendencies. It compares one thing with another, kind with kind, cauſe with cauſe, circumſtance with circumſtance, iſſue with iſſue, how they begin and how they end. Sin and luſt are indeliberate and ſudden, they muſt have a preſent compliance; they allow of no conſideration, <hi>they conſider not that they do evil,</hi> Eccleſ. 5.1. <hi>He conſiders not that the dead are there, and that her gueſts are in the depths of hell,</hi> ſays <hi>Solomon</hi> of the ſimple ſinner, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.18.</p>
               <p>Conſideration would break the force of luſt, and ſpoil Satans deſign. Would men but ſeriouſly ponder what ſin is, and what the Soul is; how deceitful, how vain, how unſatisfying, how brutiſh the one, and how noble, how precious, how immortal the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they would not ſtake and pawn them to every baſe luſt as they do. Would they but conſider of the nearneſs of death and eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; that within a few days or hours they muſt be in Heaven or Hell; that there is nothing
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:63179:145"/>
between but a little breath, which the next morſel he eats may ſtop; all hangs upon a ſmall thred of life which the next diſeaſe may fret in ſunder, they could not dally with duty, and ſlight converſion and a life of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs as they do.</p>
               <p>What is the reaſon that men are better up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſick bed than at another time? that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is then prized, and repentance ſought, and holineſs deſired, which in health were ſlighted and put off? the reaſon is, the ſenſe of their condition; their caſe makes them conſiderate, and conſideration gives death and eternity a near approach, and than they do make other kind of impreſſions than when we look on them at a diſtance. Had we but the ſame thoughts of theſe things in health as we ſhall have in ſickneſs, we ſhould labour for Grace and Holineſs as much now, as we ſhall then wiſh we had. I tell you, you don't conſider enough of the nearneſs of death and eternity; and he that puts the evil day far off, will put the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt off too, and ſo he is undone by his own ſecurity.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is from the unſuitableneſs that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the things of Chriſt and the temper of a ſinner. Chriſts <hi>Yoke</hi> doth no way fit a carnal heart; and where there is unſutableneſs there will be diſlike.<note place="margin">Matt. 16.23.</note> They <hi>ſavour not the things that be of God.</hi> A carnal heart is ſatisfyed with car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal contentments and delights; a rattle will pleaſe a child, and a toy be more welcome to a fool than a Crown. Every nature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in things ſutable to it ſelf; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:63179:145"/>
it is that <hi>the carnal mind is enmity againſt God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.7.</note> that it neither is nor <hi>can be ſubject to the law of God;</hi> for how can ſpiritual things be ſutable and reliſhing to a carnal heart? If Chriſt ſhould come to the ambitious man, and ſay, follow me and I will give thee all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and grandeur of this world; or to the voluptuous man, and ſay, follow me and I will give thee all the pleaſures of ſenſe and fleſh; or to the covetous man, and ſay, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me and I will fill thy Bags and thy Barns; I will bleſs the Ship and the Shop; I will give thee the treaſures of the Earth and the Sea; this would do more than all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the Goſpel. The young man had never left Chriſt as he did, had he but urged ſuch an argument as this for his heart to cloſe with. It is the baſe love of this preſent world that makes the call of the Goſpel ſo unſucceſsful and ineffectual; you may ſee it in that parable, <hi>Matt.</hi> 22.5. They <hi>make light</hi> of the tenders of Chriſt, and what is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? why the <hi>Farm,</hi> and the <hi>Oxen,</hi> and the <hi>Merchandiſe</hi> were in the caſe; theſe muſt not be left for Chriſt where luſt hath the caſting voice. O how ſad is this! if Chriſt ſhould offer you riches and honours, you would come, and yet for Heaven and Glory you will not.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is becauſe they are deceived and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled, partly by the cunning of Satan who puts a falſe varniſh upon things.</p>
               <p>Partly by the deceitfulneſs of their own hearts, which turns them aſide, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:63179:146"/>
ſee and ſay it is <hi>a lye which they have in their right hand.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſai. 44.20.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Partly from the deluſive appearances of things; which, by reaſon of both the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, ſeem other than they are. <hi>Bernard</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhes of four ſorts of things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some things are <hi>good</hi> and <hi>pleaſant:</hi> ſo is communion with God, for there is the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt goodneſs and the higheſt ſweetneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some things are <hi>good</hi> but not <hi>pleaſant,</hi> as repentance, and mortification, and ſelf-denial.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some things are neither <hi>good</hi> nor <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant;</hi> as utter deſpair in the preſent State; it is a thing full of ſin and ſorrow.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Some things are <hi>pleaſant</hi> but not <hi>good:</hi> and ſuch are the delights of ſin; they are <hi>ſweet</hi> but not <hi>ſafe,</hi> they <hi>pleaſe</hi> but they <hi>deceive.</hi> It is the ſweetneſs of ſin that gives it counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, it would never be committed if there were no pleaſure in it. And herein the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs of ſin conſiſts;<note place="margin">Heb. 3.13.</note> it allures by fair baits, and kills by a ſharp hook; it tempts by its ſweets, and deſtroys by its ſnares. Sin is like poyſon, very luſcious but very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; the pleaſant taſte invites, and the ſinner can't refrain, though that which is ſweet in the mouth be in the belly bitter as wormwood. Many are ſo bewitched to their luſt, that though they know it will coſt them their Souls, yet they can't renounce its plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
               <p>Now theſe five things put together, namely, Ignorance, Unbelief, Security, Unſutableneſs
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:63179:146"/>
of ſpiritual things, and the deceitfulneſs of Sin, are the cauſes why ſo many ſlight the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let me in the next place, having ſhewed you the cauſes of it, lay before you the aggravations of it, for it is a ſin of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hainous nature to put off and ſlight com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under Chriſts <hi>Yoke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, it is baſe diſingenuity; for we don't deal with God as we would have him deal with us. When we want any mercy we muſt be heard at firſt call; but God calls for duty again and again, and we hear him not. We are impatient if God delays us, and yet we make no ſcruple to delay him. When we have any thing for God to do, that muſt be done ſpeedily; <hi>In the day when I call, anſwer me ſpeedily,</hi> Pſal. 102.2. But when God hath any thing for us to do, there we take leiſure. If we would have mercy, that muſt be <hi>to day;</hi> but if God calls for duty, we put him off till the <hi>morrow.</hi> Now this is baſely diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous, that when we can't bear Gods delays, yet we make him bear ours, although the caſe is not the ſame; for we are bound to anſwer Gods precepts, but he is not bound to anſwer our requeſts; and yet we make him tarry our ſinful leiſure in the buſineſs of duty, though we think much to tarry his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leiſure in the caſe of mercy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is down-right diſobedience; he that delays a duty tranſgreſſes the precept, and ſlights the divine Authority. The ſeaſon is as much a part of the command as the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:63179:147"/>
thing commanded. If God ſays, <hi>return ye now every one from his evil way</hi> (Jer. 18.11.) the <hi>now</hi> is as much a duty as the <hi>returning.</hi> If the Father ſays to his Son, <hi>go work to day in my vineyard,</hi> Matt. 21.28. it is flat diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to defer it till to morrow; for the time of working is as much a duty as the work it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is the higheſt ingratitude; for Chriſt did not adjourn his love to us one day; his heart was to us from everlaſting; <hi>I was ſet up from everlaſting—rejoycing in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable parts of the earth, and my delights were with the ſons of men,</hi> Prov. 8.23.31. He gave himſelf in the Covenant of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to dye for ſin, and redeem ſinners from the firſt day that ſin entred. And therefore he is ſaid to be <hi>a lamh ſlain from the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world,</hi> Revel. 13.8. Though he came not to dye actually till <hi>the fullneſs of time,</hi> (Galat. 4.4.) yet in the decree of God the Father, and in the conſent of God the Son, he was a Saviour from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and his Blood was as efficacious to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, before ever it was ſhed, as after; he was a Saviour and Redeemer from the firſt entrance of ſin; <hi>Adam, Noah, Abraham,</hi> and all the Saints that lived before his Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were ſaved by his Blood as well as we. His love bears date from everlaſting, and it breaks forth very early in the overt acts of it to particular perſons. Chriſt begins with ſinners betimes; who knows how ſoon? puts upon many of them a federal holineſs betimes; ſeals them for his betimes; puts
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:63179:147"/>
his ſpirits into them betimes; and calls them to an actual cloſe with him betimes; it is hard to ſay how ſoon, but it appears to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry early in that many have been converted from their very childhood, as <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> and others. O the earlineſs of the love of Chriſt! and ſhall we adjourn our obedience as if we were afraid of cloſing with him too ſoon? he took up our <hi>burden</hi> betimes; and ſhall we delay the taking up his <hi>Yoke</hi> for the laſt work of our lives? This is great ingratitude.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is manifeſt injuſtice, and a fraudulent detaining of Chriſts right. For whoſe you are, his your ſtrength and ſervice is; and are ye not the Lords? hath he not redeemed you, and that both by <hi>price</hi> at the hands of God, and by <hi>power</hi> out of the hands of Satan? ye are <hi>the redeemed of the Lord,</hi> and therefore you are his; your time is his; your gifts and parts are his; your affections are his; your eſtates are his; your ſtrength is his; your youth is his; your body and ſoul are his; your <hi>all</hi> is his; and therefore not to give up your ſelves body and ſoul to him, not to love, and fear, and ſerve him, is a cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing injuſtice. Nay, to delay it one day, one moment, is to deny him his right. Many boaſt of their honeſty, they are juſt to all, and wrong none; yes, you wrong your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, you are unjuſt to Jeſus Chriſt, and that is the higheſt injuſtice in the world. To delay any man in that which is his right, is a great ſin; the wages of the hireling muſt be
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:63179:148"/>
paid at the day, and it muſt be done <hi>before the ſun be ſet,</hi> Deut. 24.14, 15. It is a maxim in the Law, <hi>minus ſolvit, qui minus tempore ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit;</hi> not to pay at the time is to pay the leſs, becauſe there is ſo much advantage for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement loſt. Is it ſuch a ſin to detain a ſervants right? what is it then to detain our Lords right? muſt we not withhold wages for a ſervants work till the ſun be ſet? and yet dare we withhold doing our Lords work till the ſun of our lives is ſetting? O what baſe injuſtice is this!</p>
               <p>Fifthly, It is altogether unreaſonable, there is no man living can give a reaſon to excuſe him from this duty. You cannot ſay it is the <hi>wrong way</hi> to Heaven; for it is the way the Lord Chriſt hath directed and chalked out. You cannot ſay it is a <hi>needleſs Yoke,</hi> for there is no Salvation without taking it upon you. You cannot ſay it is a <hi>dangerous Yoke,</hi> for it hath ſalvation certainly intailed upon it. You cannot ſay it is a <hi>fruitleſs Yoke,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 11.28.</note> for it yields perfect peace and laſting joy to all that come under it. You cannot ſay it is an <hi>impoſſible Yoke,</hi> for as you have the command of Chriſt to undertake it, ſo you have the promiſe of Chriſt to help and inable you to bear it. So that you cannot give one reaſon why you ſhould neglect it; and therefore he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes to take it up is without excuſe. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever remains graceleſs in a day of Grace, will be found ſpeechleſs in the Day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.<note place="margin">Matt. 22.12.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:63179:148"/>Sixthly, It is downright madneſs; for you refuſe Heaven becauſe you will not be holy. You will rather loſe the eternal injoyment of God than be made like God. You will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuſe to periſh under the wrath of Chriſt, than you will conſent to come under the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt. You will be contented to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſo you may go a pleaſant way to Hell. And is not this madneſs to the height to chuſe rather to periſh eternally than be tied to love and ſerve your maker and redeemer? O what a baſe and low opinion have you of God and Heaven! how can ye degrade and diſhonour him more?</p>
               <p>If a man ſhould publiſh it as his opinion, that darkneſs is better than light; that Hell is rather to be choſen than Heaven; that he had rather be in an everlaſting ſociety with Devils and damned Spirits, than with God and Chriſt in the glory above; what would you ſay of ſuch a one but that he talked like a mad man? why then reflect upon your ſelves a little, for, —<hi>mutato nomine do te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Fabula narratur.</hi>—you that prefer the pleaſures of ſin to the ſervice of Chriſt; that will renounce your part in God and Chriſt and eternal happineſs, to ſatisfie a baſe luſt; that will ſtake your Souls for a few minutes of ſinful delights; can any man be guilty of greater madneſs? do ye know what ye do, or what ye ſpeak, when ye ſay in your hearts this luſt ſhall reign, but Chriſt ſhall not reign? <hi>let us break his bonds,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 2.3.</note> 
                  <hi>and caſt his cords far away from us?</hi> this is

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Now having ſhewed you the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes why ſo many do neglect taking up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt; and laid before you the aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſin; let me lay down but three conſiderations, if the hardneſs of your heart will ſuffer you to take them in.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Conſider what you will anſwer to Chriſt for ſlighting his <hi>Yoke;</hi> do ye believe there is ſuch a day coming wherein the Lord Chriſt will ſit in judgment upon every Soul, and in which every one muſt give an account of himſelf to God; if ye do not, ye do not owne the Bible; ye do not believe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to be the word of God: for there is no truth more plainly atteſted in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures than this: See <hi>Acts</hi> 17.31. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5, 6. and <hi>chap.</hi> 14.10, 11, 12. 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5. 10.2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.8, 9, 10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. <hi>James</hi> 5.9. <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. 12, 13. and many places more. And if ye do believe a judgment to come, pray tell me what you think the buſineſs of that day will be? will it not be to take an account how you and I have carried it to Chriſt? God hath ſent him into the world to dye for ſinners,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.10.</note> to bring <hi>life and immortality
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:63179:149"/>
to light through the Goſpel,</hi> to fix the terms and conditions of life and ſalvation: and theſe terms are ſubjection and obedience to Jeſus Chriſt and his commands as King and Lord; and the buſineſs of that day will be to take an account what complyance we have made with theſe terms; not whether we have profeſſed him, and outwardly owned him; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have cloſed with him upon the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Goſpel. Now you that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed or neglected taking up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt, how will you anſwer it to Chriſt in that dreadful Day?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Will you ſay you were not called? that you cannot; for God hath called you many ways; many of you have had calls by your Parents in a Godly education; calls by inſtruction; calls by counſel; calls by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; calls by Godly examples; many of you have been called by being placed in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious families under Godly Maſters, or Godly Tutors and Governours.<note place="margin">Mic. 6.9.</note> Many of you have been called by afflictions, by the voice of the rod of God; all of you have been called by the diſpenſation of the Goſpel; for what is the work of Miniſters but to call you to Chriſt to take up his <hi>Yoke?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Will you ſay you were too young? that you can't; for others as young as you have heard his call, and obeyed, taking up his <hi>Yoke</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times. Beſides, it is your duty to make it your firſt work, <hi>Matt.</hi> 6.33. <hi>Seek ye firſt the kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Will you ſay you have preſent concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:63179:150"/>
that muſt firſt be attended to? that you cannot; for there is nothing in the World of ſo great concernment as this. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, God hath made a promiſe of all other things to Godlineſs for this very reaſon, that we might be incouraged to an early practice of it, and to leave the neglecters of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuſe, <hi>Matt.</hi> 6.33. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11.</p>
               <p>Will you ſay, you expected a longer time in the World for this work? but how could that be? why ſhould you expect what God never promiſed? or why ſhould God length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en your days for you to ſpend in the ſervice of your luſts? you that would not repent of ſin, and turn to Chriſt in the time that God gave you for that purpoſe; neither would you have done it if the Lord had lengthened your life to the age of <hi>Methuſelah.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your mouth will be ſtopped,<note place="margin">Matt. 22.12.</note> and you found ſpeechleſs in that dreadful Day of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider you that will not come under the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt, muſt come under the wrath of Chriſt: You ſhake off this, you cannot ſhake off that. There is a two-fold diſpenſation of wrath to theſe Sons of <hi>Belial;</hi> one in this World, the other in the World to come.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That in this World lies in giving them up to their own corrupt wills, and luſts of their own hearts. And this is <hi>wrath to the uttermoſt,</hi> as it is call'd 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.16. There can be no greater expreſſion of Gods wrath
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:63179:150"/>
in this world, than to give a man up to his own luſts. And when a man ſits under Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-ſeaſons, and hath ſin diſovered, Chriſt tendred, faith and obedience preſſed upon him, and yet will not hearken to the voice of God herein, nor leave his luſts for Chriſt, that man is very near to this judgment. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.11.12. <hi>My people would not heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to my voice, Iſrael would none of me, ſo I gave them up to their own hearts luſts, and they walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their own counſels.</hi> This is a diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of wrath in this world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a diſpenſation of wrath in the next world, and that lies in the pouring out of eternal vengeance. Now I pray conſider this: you can refuſe preſent obedience, but can ye refuſe eternal vengeance? you may ſay, I will not come under Chriſt's <hi>Yoke;</hi> but can you ſay, I will not come under his wrath? You read of ſome that call for the mountains to fall on them, and <hi>hide them from the wrath of the lamb,</hi> Revel. 6.16. but all in vain. <hi>How ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great ſalvation?</hi> Heb. 2.3. mark, <hi>if we neglect;</hi> he doth not ſay, if we reject and renounce it; if we ſcoff at, and deride it; if we oppoſe and perſecute it; no, but if we <hi>neglect</hi> it; the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the ſame as in <hi>Matt.</hi> 22.5. <hi>They made light of it.</hi> If we make light of, let ſlip, ſhift off, take no preſent care of our ſalvation, what then? <hi>how ſhall we eſcape?</hi> that is, there can be no eſcaping the wrath of God. It is ſomewhat like that expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Thinkeſt thou this, O man,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:63179:151"/>
that thou ſhalt eſcape the judgment of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Conſider where will you lay the blame of your deſtruction? you can't lay it upon God; for he gave Chriſt to redeem and ſave you. You can't lay it upon Chriſt; for he <hi>would have gathered you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 23.37.</note> 
                  <hi>and you would not;</hi> he never caſt you off till you caſt him off. You can't lay it upon the ſpirit; for he would have convinced, and converted, and ſanctifyed you, and you have reſiſted and quenched him. You cannot lay it upon your miniſters; for they have ſet before you life and death, and declared to you the danger of ſin, and the neceſſity of holineſs, but you would not believe their report. You can't lay it upon your ignorance; for either you do know your duty, and then your diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is inexcuſable; or you might know it if you would, and ſo your ignorance is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable. You can't lay it upon your want of leiſure and time: for you have time to ſpare for your luſts, for your ſports, and paſtimes, and pleaſures, and why not for Chriſt? ſo that you can lay the blame no where but upon a curſed corrupt Heart, <hi>thy deſtruction is of thy ſelf,</hi> Hoſ. 13.9.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>USE</hi> 2. <hi>Of examination.</hi> If it be the great concernment of every one to take up Chriſts <hi>Yoke</hi> betimes; then the queſtion is, what progreſs have you made in this duty? what <hi>Yoke</hi> are you under? that of ſin, or that of Chriſt? for all men, young and old, rich and poor, high and low, bond and free, are under one of theſe <hi>Yokes,</hi> either the <hi>Yoke</hi> of ſin, or the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt. Theſe are the two great Lords of the world, and have the moſt extenſive rule and dominion; and therefore as ye read of the rule and Government of Chriſt, ſo you read of the rule of luſt,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.17, 18.</note> and the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſin; and of being <hi>ſervants of ſin,</hi> and <hi>ſervants of righteouſneſs.</hi> Now whoſe <hi>Yoke</hi> are ye under?<note place="margin">Matt. 6.24.</note> no man can be ſaid to be under both; <hi>no man can ſerve</hi> theſe <hi>two masters.</hi> He that is under the <hi>Yoke</hi> of ſin is <hi>free from righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 6.20. And he that is under the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt is free from ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. Can ye make it out that ye are under the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt? this is a queſtion of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great importance, and therefore every man ſhould labour to be ſatisfyed about it. And that for theſe ſeven reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe every one of us are naturally under the <hi>Yoke</hi> and thraldom of ſin; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant of God and Chriſt, but enemies
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:63179:152"/>
to God and Chriſt; and not only enemies by natural depravation, but by actual oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; <hi>enemies by wicked works,</hi> Coloſſ. 1.21. <hi>ſerving divers luſts and pleaſures,</hi> Tit. 3.3. Every man naturally is the ſervant of ſin (<hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17.) till he be made free by Chriſt, and brought under his <hi>Yoke</hi> by the power of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Grace. Now what do ye know of this in your ſelves? can ye ſay, <hi>being made free from ſin, ye became the ſervants of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</hi> Rom. 6.18.</p>
               <p n="2">2. So long as a man is under the power of ſin, he is in a ſtate of wrath. The reign of ſin ſubjects the ſoul to the wrath of God; and no wonder, for it is the higheſt contempt and affront the creature can put upon God to give up himſelf to the dominion of ſin;<note place="margin">1 John 3.4. Amos 2.4.</note> 
                  <hi>he that doth ſin, tranſgreſſeth the law;</hi> but he that ſubjects himſelf to the power of it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temns the law, and deſpiſes the Authority of him that gave it; and there is nothing can lay man under the wrath of God more than this.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe many there are that deceive themſelves about the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they have put it on, when they are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken. Few will deny that ſubjection to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is a duty; but the miſery is, they undo themſelves with a ſelf-deluding confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that they have taken the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt upon them when they have not. Many bleſs themſelves in the goodneſs of their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the uprightneſs of their hearts with Chriſt, when it is no ſuch matter. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>there is a generation that are pure in their
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:63179:152"/>
own eyes, and yet are not waſhed from their fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs,</hi> Prov. 30.12. This was the caſe of <hi>Laodicea;</hi> ſhe thought her ſelf rich, her ſtate good, her intereſt firm, her heart right, when it was quite otherwiſe; <hi>wretched, and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and poor, and blind, and naked,</hi> Revel. 3.17. who better perſwaded of the goodneſs of his caſe than <hi>Paul,</hi> and yet he was an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enemy to Jeſus Chriſt at the ſame time? <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To be deceived in a matter of this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a thing of very dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. If you take counterfeit money for true, the loſs is not great; but if you take common Grace for ſaving Grace, an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical obedience to Chriſt, for ſubjection to the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt, a deceit in this matter is as much as the ſoul is worth. It is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing miſtake;<note place="margin">Matt. 25. v. 1.</note> the <hi>fooliſh virgins</hi> that <hi>went out to meet the bridegroom,</hi> thought their hearts had been right with Chriſt; that they had had oyl enough in their lamps,<note place="margin">v. 3.</note> and of the right kind, till the coming of Chriſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the miſtake;<note place="margin">v. 10.</note> and it was ſuch a miſtake as proved their utter undoing.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is a good argument of the goodneſs of thy condition, and of thy ſincerity of heart to be willing to come to the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone. Some are great enemies to trying Doctrines; they can't indure the ſearches of the word; but cry out againſt ſuch preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as cenſorious; theſe men will take Gods work out of his hand, and be judges of mens hearts and ſtates, ſay they. This is a very great
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:63179:153"/>
ſign of an unſound heart;<note place="margin">John 3.20.</note> 
                  <hi>they come not to the light leſt their deeds ſhould be reproved. Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> ſays of Hereticks, they are <hi>lucifugae ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarum,</hi> they cannot indure to be tryed by the word. So it is with an unſound profeſſor.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The knowledge of this is of great uſe, living and dying.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is very uſeful in life, it is that which you will be forced to have recourſe to a thouſand times before you dye. When temptations or deſertions are upon you, the ſenſe of the uprightneſs of your heart in your walking with God will be an admirable ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. So it was to <hi>Job,</hi> when he was under the hidings of God, and had loſt the wonted comfort of the light of his countenance, he comforts himſelf in his own uprightneſs. <hi>He knows the way that I take,—my foot hath held his ſteps, his way have I kept and not declined, neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips,</hi> Job 23.11, 12.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is of great uſe in death. For what is it that can ſupport the ſoul in a dying hour, but a ſenſe of intereſt in Chriſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced by the uprightneſs of the heart in walking with him. This was that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had recourſe to when the ſentence of death was upon him, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 38.3. <hi>Remember O Lord how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which was good in thy ſight.</hi> O it is a bleſſed thing in a dying hour to have a witneſſing conſcience to the ſincerity of our obedience. For <hi>if our hearts condemn us not, then have we confidence
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:63179:153"/>
towards God,</hi> 1 John 3.21. It is of great uſe therefore to put this matter to the tryal. For,</p>
               <p n="7">7. The day is coming when God will put it to the tryal. <hi>The fire</hi> of that day <hi>ſhall try every mans work of what ſort it is.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.13.</note> It is not the livery of Chriſt, nor the badge of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, nor the name of a Chriſtian, nor out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profeſſion of Religion that will ſtead us in that Day. It is not ſaying <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 7.21.</note> but <hi>doing the will of God</hi> that will then ſtand us in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtead; not a profeſſion of Chriſt, but an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeigned ſubjection to him. Chriſt is ſaid in that Day to <hi>ſeparate the ſheep from the goats,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 25.32, 33.</note> and to <hi>ſet the ſheep at his right hand, and the goats at his left.</hi> The one for a bleſſing, the other for a curſe. And who are the ſheep? why he tells you <hi>John</hi> 10.27. they that <hi>hear his voice and follow him;</hi> and to theſe he gives <hi>eternal life,</hi> v. 28. And who are the goats? but carnal ſinners that will have their luſts ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Chriſt; that caſt off his <hi>Yoke,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 19. v. 14. v. 27.</note> and will not have him rule over them. And what is their doom? <hi>bring them out and ſlay them before me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There will be but two ſorts of men in that day; ſaints and ſinners; obedient and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient; ſubjects and rebels; the great que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion then will be, whoſe ſervants you have been? to whom have you lived? to the world? to luſt? or to Jeſus Chriſt? and according to this, ſo ſhall your ſentence be; as you have lived, ſo ſhall you be judged, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.6, 7, 8. And therefore as ever you would be
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:63179:154"/>
able to lift up your heads in the Day of Gods tryal, it concerns you to try your ſelves.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I will anſwer the queſtion firſt Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Negatively.</hi> There are ſome of whom it may be ſaid without the leaſt raſhneſs of judgment, or breach of charity, that they are far from the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt; profeſſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels to his Government and Authority. They carry the tokens of Death and Damnation in their foreheads: the Holy Ghoſt reckons them up in ſeveral places of Scripture, one is in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>Be not deceived, neither for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, nor abuſers of themſelves with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, ſhall inherit the kingdom of God,</hi> Revel. 21.8. <hi>The fearful and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and ſorcerers, and idolaters, and all lyars, ſhall have their part in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the ſecond Death.</hi> Theſe are all ſons of <hi>Belial,</hi> they are not under the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:63179:154"/>
you conſider a little, if any of theſe ſins be chargeable upon you, your caſe is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate; you are actually ſhut out from any claim in Chriſt. You may know, as certainly as if God had told you from Heaven, that you are in a loſt undone condition; the Holy Ghoſt calls all ſuch <hi>children of diſobedience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of theſe things the wrath of God cometh upon the children of diſobedience,</hi> Epheſ. 5.6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such as are ſcoffers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at Godlineſs, and make a mock of Religion. This is one of the reigning ſins of this Day, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3. <hi>There ſhall come in the laſt days ſcoffers, walking after their own luſts.</hi> Mark, while they ſcoff at Godlineſs, they live in ungodlineſs, <hi>walk after their own luſts;</hi> they will not leave their luſts, and therefore ſcoff at Religion becauſe that oppoſes their luſts. Now what ſays the Scripture? <hi>Judgment is prepared for ſcorners,</hi> Prov. 19.29. 2 Chron. 36.16. Theſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do openly declare they are not under the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Such as have a ſecret enmity againſt the power of Religion; they have <hi>a form of godlineſs, but deny the power of it,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.5. Theſe can be no ſubjects of Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, for the Kingdom of God is not in word but in power.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Such as have their ſecret reſerve in clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with Chriſt; they will not let <hi>Benjamin</hi> go; ſome ſweet ſin, ſome profitable luſt they will not part with. Theſe are not under the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt, for he that comes to Chriſt, and <hi>hates not father, and mother, and
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:63179:155"/>
wife, and children, and brethren, and ſiſters, yea and his own life alſo, he cannot be my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple,</hi> Luke 14.26.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Such as live in the ſinful neglect of Gods worſhip, that ſlight hearing the word, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain prayer before God;</hi> have no regard to their Souls. Such are not under the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt; <hi>for he that is of God heareth Gods word,</hi> John 8.47. No man that ſlights the word and worſhip of God, can be under Chriſts <hi>Yoke;</hi> for it is the word that faſtens this <hi>Yoke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Such as give up themſelves to carnal pleaſures and delights, that <hi>are lovers of pleaſures more than lovers of God,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.4. Theſe were never yet under the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt, for <hi>they that are Chriſts have crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the fleſh with the affections and luſts,</hi> Gal. 5.24.</p>
               <p n="7">7. He that truſts to his own righteouſneſs, and looks to find acceptance for that, was never under the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt; for this is a plain rejecting of Chriſt, it puts him out of office; a man makes a Saviour of his own duties, and ſo as other men periſh by their ſins, this man periſhes by his duties. None do reject Chriſt more than theſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. <hi>Going about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they have not ſubmitted to the righteouſneſs of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Such as ſee no need of any ſtrength for duty but their own, can do all without any ſupernatural aids and divine incomes; ſuch were never under the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt.
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:63179:155"/>
For that will ſhew a man his daily need of divine power for every performance.</p>
               <p n="9">9. He that never felt the burden of ſin, was never under the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt. For none elſe are call'd to take it up, <hi>Matt.</hi> 11.28, 29.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Such as maintain an ungrounded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the goodneſs of their condition, without any experience of a change made in them, are perſwaded their ſtate is ſafe, but cannot ſhew one good ground for it; theſe are not under the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>O that you that are young would lay theſe things to heart, for now we are upon the ſearch, I pray therefore look every one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; is it thus with you? for let me tell you, whoever is under any one of theſe Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters hath never yet took up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt. They ſhall be reckoned among the enemies of Chriſt that have rejected his <hi>Yoke,</hi> deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Authority, and as ſuch they ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, except by a timely converſion they be brought to cloſe with and ſubmit to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Affirmatively.</hi> How may a man know when he is really and indeed under the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt? how may he come to a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the goodneſs of his ſtate, by the truth of his Subjection to the Lord Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Give me leave to anſwer the queſtion,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> More generally.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> More particularly.</p>
               <p>Firſt, More generally. There are ſome things that will greatly contribute to this, and without which he will never attain to a
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:63179:156"/>
well grounded ſatisfaction in this matter; and therefore they are very neceſſary to be conſidered, and made uſe of in this inquiry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> 1. One is a full and deliberate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with your own hearts. He that makes a judgment upon ſlight inquiries, and ſudden inconſiderate anſwers, is very like to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; judgment ought not to be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced but upon a full hearing, and a through debate; <hi>ad pauca reſpicit, qui cito pronunciat,</hi> it is not judgment, but fond opinion that is paſſed upon a matter, without hearing all that is fit to be ſaid about it, therefore ſo great a matter as this is ſhould not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined but upon mature deliberation. As it is ſaid of counſel, <hi>omne conſilium in feſtinatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne captum, ſtultitia eſt;</hi> all counſel taken in haſt is folly. The ſame may be ſaid of judging our ſelves, all haſty precipitate judgment is folly; the way to come to a rational cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty is to make a full inquiry. Hypocrites and carnal ſinners overlook what is evil, and judge by any good they find; and weak Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians overlook what is good, and judge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the evil that is diſcovered; this is judgement upon hearing but of one ſide, and he that doth ſo is an <hi>unjuſt Judge,</hi> though he ſhould happen to paſs a <hi>juſt judgment</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Qui ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid ſtatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erit alterâ parte inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditâ, ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quum licet ſtatuerit, haud aequus est.</note>; there muſt be a ſearching out the caſe, that neither ſin may be paſſed by on the one hand, nor grace overlooked on the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:63179:156"/>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> 2. Another thing in this inquiry is the light of the ſpirit; this is very neceſſary in ſuch a work. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>The ſpirit of a man is the candle of the Lord,</hi> Prov. 20.27. But the ſpirit of the Lord is the light of this candle, without which he cannot ſee <hi>into the inward parts of the belly:</hi> It is this that <hi>brings to light the hidden things of darkneſs, and makes manifeſt the counſels of the heart,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.5. What is the meaning of that Prayer of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Pſal 139.23, 24. <hi>Search me O God, and know my heart; try me, and know my thoughts, and ſee if there be any wicked way in me.</hi> He doth hereby beg for ſuch a meaſure of the ſpirits light and aid (which ſearcheth all things 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>2.10.) as may enable him to ſuch a ſearch of his heart, whereby he may be fully aſſured of the goodneſs of his eſtate. You will never be able to come to a true knowledge of your ſtate and heart but by the ſpirits light and help.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> 3. Another means is frequent and repeated tryals. It is not enough for a man that would be ſatisfied of his ſpiritual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to bring his heart to the touchſtone now and then; it muſt be done often, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the variety of conditions, occaſions, and temptations. In our Law, a man can be but once tryed for one fact, becauſe his life ſhall not be always in hazard. But in ſpiritual matters the oftner we are brought to the bar, the better; frequent tryals do not hazard our caſe, but tend to put it out of hazard. How ſhould a man know much
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:63179:157"/>
of his ſpiritual ſtate that ſeldom converſeth with his own heart?</p>
               <p>It was a good rule, <hi>Tecum habita.</hi> A mans buſineſs lies moſt within doors; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhould often deſcend into himſelf. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> counſel is, <hi>Commune with your own heart upon your bed,</hi> Pſal. 4.4. The word in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew is,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>ſpeak to your own heart;</hi> the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is not limited, and therefore may take in all thoſe ways of ſpeaking by which a man may keep up a ſecret, inward and profitable communion with his own ſoul. And this is adviſed to be done upon the bed; which notes <hi>Retiredneſs</hi> and <hi>Frequency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Retiredneſs. In the bed a man is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired from the diſtracting noiſes and hurries of the World<note n="*" place="margin">Nox tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum eſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus conſiderandis, &amp; diligentius examinandis, tum enim animus ſedatior eſſe ſolet. <hi>Moller. in Loc.</hi>
                  </note>, and ſo is at leiſure for the work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Frequency, As oft as a man lies down upon his bed, he ſhould go down into his heart, and call himſelf to account eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry night where his heart has been, and what it hath done every day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> 4. Try till the matter be fully deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and you come to a rational and well grounded ſatisfaction in your ſelves, that ſo you may have an anſwer in readineſs to put all doubts and ſcruples to ſilence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> 5. Another way is by obſerving and fixing upon the fitteſt ſeaſons. There is a time for every thing; there is a time to try,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:63179:157"/>
and a time to truſt without tryal; a time to look inward, and a time when it is more proper to look upward. Every time is not a fit ſeaſon for this work; ſometimes the Soul is beclouded, tempted, deſerted, defiled by new ſins, and theſe are times where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is ſet againſt it ſelf; and now all is naught, all is Hypocriſie; <hi>praejudicium tollit judicium,</hi> it is commonly ſeen ſo. When <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> is under the hiding of God, how is judgment blinded, and all Grace is hid. If <hi>David</hi> be under a cloud, preſently he is caſt off. He that looks upon his face in a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken glaſs will appear a moſt deformed crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: As he that walks in a dark night, is apt to think every buſh a Thief; he fanſies nothing but objects of fear and terrour; ſo it is in this caſe. And therefore in ſuch a condition it is better to call uppn the Soul, as <hi>David</hi> did, to truſt and wait. Multiply direct acts of Faith more, and reflect leſs. It is an excellent piece of wiſdom to take the proper ſeaſon for every duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> 6. If upon good evidence thou art able to prove the ſincerity of thy heart to Chriſt, don't queſtion the goodneſs of thy ſtate becauſe of the Hypocrites carnal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. The fooliſh Virgins thought their Oyl as good as that of the wiſe, but the Oyl of the wiſe Virgins was of the right kind notwithſtanding that. Many a corrupt Judge paſſes a wrong ſentence, but a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judge, that guides himſelf by evidence and Law, may do right for all that. Many a
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:63179:158"/>
man may be rich in a Dream, but what then? may not therefore a waking man know what his Eſtate is, or whether it be his or not? The <hi>Turk</hi> is confident of his Religion; the <hi>Jew</hi> as confident of his; the <hi>Papist</hi> is certain of his to an infallibility; and yet this doth not hinder but that a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> may certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know that he is in the true way, and that they are wofully deceived and given up to believe lies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> 7. Be ſure to make uſe of a right rule to judge by, for <hi>Rectum eſt index ſui &amp; obliqui;</hi> No man can make a true judgment but by a right rule; if that be crooked or falſe, the judgment that is made by it muſt needs be wrong. If the touchſtone be not right, you can never judge of the metal.</p>
               <p>Before I ſhew you which is the true rule, let me warn you againſt ſome falſe rules which many try and deceive themſelves by.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Some meaſure themſelves by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; ſuch the Apoſtle ſpeaks of 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 10.12. <hi>They meaſure themſelves by themſelves, and compare themſelves with themſelves.</hi> But he charges this practice with folly, ſays he, <hi>they are not wiſe,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. They never come to underſtand their caſe; alas how ſhould they? the obliquity of the perſon is hid in the crookedneſs of the rule. For a man to be his own rule and ſtandard is great folly, and yet nothing more common than to judge a mans ſelf by the preſumed goodneſs of his own heart; though it is the greateſt cheat and impoſtor in the World: The Holy Ghoſt
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:63179:158"/>
tells us ſo, <hi>the heart is deceitful above all things,</hi> Jerem. 17.9. You read of <hi>deceitful</hi> riches, <hi>Matt.</hi> 13.22. <hi>deceitful</hi> weights, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.11. <hi>deceitful</hi> witneſſes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.25. <hi>deceitful</hi> Prophets, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 23.26. <hi>deceitful</hi> tongues, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52.4. a <hi>deceitful</hi> Devil, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.3. but the heart is deceitful above them all; Satan himſelf could never deceive a man if his own heart did not deceive him. It hath a thouſand deceits: It paints ſin with the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of vertue: It hides from a man the evil that is real, and flatters him with a good that is ſeeming: It perſwades a man he hath the good he hath not; and if there be any good, that the good he hath is greater than it is: It preſents him with common Grace for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: It makes him take education for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and moral virtues for Goſpel Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: It is endleſs to trace the heart in its ſeveral deceits; and therefore for a man to meaſure himſelf by himſelf, when the heart is ſo deceitful, muſt needs be a falſe rule of judgment.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Some meaſure themſelves by ſuch as come ſhort of their attainments; thus did the <hi>Phariſee</hi> in <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.11. <hi>God I thank thee that I am not as other men are, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioners, unjuſt, adulterers, nor as this Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican;</hi> and this was the falſe rule that deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. Alas, what is all this? nature may be refined and yet be but nature; and when all is done it giveth one man no more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of another than tame Beaſts have of wild. A tame Beaſt is as much a Beaſt as
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:63179:159"/>
they that are wild. We may not be ſo bad as the worſt, and yet may be worſe than we think; and we may be better than ſome, and yet not be ſo good as we ought.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Some make a judgment of their condition by the judgment of others. If ſuch as are Godly, wiſe, and diſcerning do approve and commend them, this puts all out of doubt, and makes them confident of their good condition. Nothing blinds a man more to himſelf than the applauſe of others; for this holds him in a pleaſant dream of an imaginary excellency, and puffs him up with an opinion of thoſe virtues in himſelf, which he is an utter ſtranger to. Alas what is the judgment of others about the truth of my Godlineſs, that I ſhould value and judge my ſelf by that? How often have good men been miſtaken in their opinion and judgment of others. The Diſciples judged <hi>Judas</hi> to have been as ſincere, and true to Chriſt as themſelves, and could ſuſpect themſelves as ſoon as him; nay rather than him. And therefore when Chriſt tells them <hi>one of you ſhall betray me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 26.21.22.</note> they every one cry out, <hi>Lord, is it I?</hi> they little thought that <hi>Iſcariot</hi> had been ſuch a <hi>Judas.</hi> How was <hi>Peter</hi> deceived in <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> in the falſe Diſciples; and never knew what they were till their Apoſtaſy detected their Hypocriſie, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.19. Men judge by what they ſee, and that is only what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears. Now a man may be one thing in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and another thing in reality. Our Lord
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:63179:159"/>
Chriſt ſpeaks of ſome that are <hi>in ſheeps clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> and yet <hi>are inwardly ravening wolves.</hi> The Opticks ſay <hi>ſolae ſuperficies videntur,</hi> we only ſee the ſurface of things; and it is true, who can ſee another mans inſide? who can tell what principle I am acted by in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God? or ſay what my aims and ends are? they may be right or wrong, true or falſe for ought any other man knows. Many ſhall in that Day, <hi>when God ſhall judge the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of men by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> be condemned for Hypocrites that have paſſed through this World with an applauſe for Eminent Saints; for ſecret ſins may be retained under an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen profeſſion of holineſs, and men judge by the profeſſion that is made, becauſe they ſee not the ſecret luſts that are indulged. This is therefore a falſe rule to judge by.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Some make outward reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to judge of their ſubjection to Chriſt by. If they leave their open wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, their ſcandalous practices, and live ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly in the World, this is a rule by which they judge their caſe good. Now this is a falſe rule to judge by.</p>
               <p>For, 1. Open ſins may be reformed, and yet heart luſts may be reſerved, and ſo the Soul is in as dangerous a condition as ever. An impoſtume in the Bowels may as ſurely kill a man as the plague in the fleſh. Where ſin is outwardly forſaken, and yet ſecretly beloved, there the Diſeaſe is not cured but ſtruck in; and ſo is as mortal as before. It is not the refraining ſin that weakens it, but
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:63179:160"/>
the withdrawing the heart from it. It is a leſs evil to do ſin and not love it, than it is to love ſin and not do it; for the doing ſin may poſſibly be from weakneſs of Grace, but the love of ſin is always from the ſtrength of luſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A man may, as to outward acts, let all ſin go, and yet be a ſecret enemy to Chriſt; for the Enmity (as the Law ſays of treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King) lies not in overt acts, but in the depravedneſs and corruption of the heart; and what is it for all luſts to be reſtrained, unleſs the heart alſo be ſubdued to Chriſt? A Dog tyed up from doing harm is a Dog ſtill. There may be a ceſſation of arms between Enemies, and yet the quarrel may remain, though the War ceaſe. A ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner may lay the weapon of ſin out of his hand, and yet the enmity againſt God ſtill remain in his heart. And therefore for a man to meaſure his Religion from an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward reformation only, is to judge by a falſe rule. Not but that an outward refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is neceſſary, (for though a man may have a bad heart under a ſtrict life, yet to be ſure he cannot have a good heart with a bad life.<note place="margin">Matt. 23.25.</note>) But this is not enough, for the <hi>outſide of the cup and platter</hi> may be cleanſed, and yet the <hi>inſide</hi> remain <hi>unclean</hi> and <hi>filthy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, Some make a profeſſion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion the meaſure of their ſubjection to Chriſt, they reckon a cleaving to his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ordinances, to be a taking up of his <hi>Yoke.</hi> Indeed it is required that all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:63179:160"/>
in Chriſt ſhould make a profeſſion of him; it is a part of the homage we owe to Chriſt to ſtick to his worſhip and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to <hi>hold faſt the faith and not deny his name.</hi> But yet for any man to judge of the truth of his ſubjection to Chriſt, by making an outward profeſſion of him, is a very wrong rule. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. How common is it to have the form ſeparated from the power: This, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tells us, is one of the ſins that ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in the laſt Days, and that ſhall make the times ſo perilous, <hi>having a form of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, but denying the power thereof,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.5. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. It is not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the true form, for <hi>forma eſt per quod res eſt id quod est.</hi> The true form of Godlineſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in an inward change, by a work of Grace; and is that which denominates a man a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, for <hi>forma dat eſſe rei.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſignifies an outward ſhew, a formality, a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor, or mask of Godlineſs; and what is that but a profeſſion; ſo that a man may wear the vizor of a profeſſion all his days, and yet be an Enemy to the power of Religion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That profeſſion of Religion which may conſiſt with a ſtate of ſpiritual death, can be no true meaſure of a mans ſubjection to Chriſt. Now a man may maintain a high profeſſion and yet be dead in ſin; <hi>thou hast a name that thou liveſt and art dead,</hi> Revel. 3.1. alive to the World by an outward ſhew, but dead to God for want of the ſubſtance.
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:63179:161"/>
What a lively profeſſor was <hi>Judas,</hi> and yet in a dead eſtate. There is never an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Goſpel but a man may be found in the uſe of it, and yet be all the while dead in ſin. No outward means of Grace did ever, nor can it, by any vertue or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of its own, quicken one dead Soul. How many ſinners abide all their days under the loud calls of the word preached, and yet periſh in their luſts; ſo that to many it is ſo far from working life, that it ſuperadds a ſecond death. <hi>To ſome we are a ſavour of death to death,</hi> 2 Cor. 2.16. and therefore a profeſſion of Religion is but a crooked rule to judge of your ſubjection to Chriſt by.</p>
               <p>Theſe are neceſſary cautions for carnal and ignorant perſons that are apt to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge their ſtate and condition by errors on the left hand. There are other cautions that are as neceſſary for weak believers, who are as apt to err on the right hand, by judging their caſe by falſe rules alſo; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by inſtead of true peace, their ſouls are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with groundleſs troubles. I will name but four.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> One is degrees of Grace, Grace in improvement; this many make a rule to judge their caſe by. And becauſe Grace is weak and little, therefore they judge it is falſe and counterfeit, and they have no Grace. Now this is a falſe rule to judge by; for it is not the quantity of Grace that proves the ſtate, but the quality. Will any man
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:63179:161"/>
ſay a peny is not ſilver becauſe a crown piece is bigger? you do not judge of it by the <hi>bigneſs</hi> but by the <hi>goodneſs.</hi> Will any man ſay it is not Day unleſs it be noon? you don't judge of the Day by the <hi>heighth</hi> of the Sun, but by the <hi>light</hi> of it. We ſhould try our ſelves as God trys us, not by the <hi>ſcale,</hi> for then we ſhould be found too light, there would be a <hi>Mene Tekel</hi> upon the beſt of us; but he trys us by the <hi>Touchſtone;</hi> if Grace be <hi>true</hi> Grace, if Obedience be <hi>ſincere,</hi> it is owned and accepted, and ſhall paſs the approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God though it be <hi>little,</hi> yea though <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo little. Thus ſaith the Lord, as the new wine is found in the cluſter, and one ſaith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it not for a bleſſing is in it, ſo will I do for my ſervants ſake,</hi> Iſai. 65.8. He will not <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the day of ſmall things,</hi> nor ſhould we.<note place="margin">Zech. 4.10.</note> We ſhould eye the weakneſs of Grace ſo as to labour to improve it, but not ſo as to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge our ſelves becauſe of it. If we would preſs forward,<note place="margin">Philip. 3.13.</note> the way is to overlook attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and leave them behind us; but if we would know our ſtate, the way is not to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlook, but to ſet them before us. Our <hi>comfort</hi> lies in the <hi>increaſe</hi> of Grace, but our <hi>ſalvation</hi> lies in the <hi>truth</hi> of Grace; for God hath not promiſed ſalvation to <hi>ſuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> but he hath promiſed it to Grace <hi>in any meaſure.</hi> Therefore though a man ought not to reſt <hi>ſatisfied</hi> with his Grace if it be <hi>never ſo much,</hi> yet he ought not to be <hi>diſcouraged</hi> though it be <hi>never ſo little.</hi> For though lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Grace poſſibly may not afford much
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:63179:162"/>
comfort, yet it proves the goodneſs of our ſtate, and ſecures our Souls.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another rule is, comparing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Saints of the higheſt attainments; and becauſe they are not come to their pitch and ſtature in Grace, therefore judge they have no Grace. As Hypocrites think their condition good, by comparing themſelves with ſuch as come ſhort of them; ſo weak be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers think their caſe bad, becauſe they judge themſelves by ſuch as have outgone them.</p>
               <p>This is another falſe meaſure, for as in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo in Grace, growth and ſtature is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. Some are but <hi>children,</hi> ſome are <hi>ſtrong men,</hi> ſome are <hi>aged</hi> and full of years; diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent growths, but the ſame life; of various ſtatures, but one in kind. So it is here; ſome are <hi>children</hi> in Grace, ſome are <hi>ſtrong men,</hi> ſome are <hi>fathers,</hi> 1 John 2.12, 13. here is Grace differing in degree but of the ſame kind. The <hi>green fig</hi> is of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with that which is <hi>ripe;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cant. 2.13.</note> and the <hi>tender grape</hi> with that which is <hi>ready for the preſs.</hi> In Chriſts Orchard, (that is his Church) there are trees of various growths,<note place="margin">Cant. 4.14.</note> 
                  <hi>Spikenard, and Saffron, Calamus and Cinamon, with all trees of Frankincenſe, Myrrh and Aloes. Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> makes theſe to ſet forth the ſeveral ſorts of Chriſtians; ſome are newly ſprung up, theſe are the <hi>Spikenard and Saffron,</hi> Herbs that do appear but little above the ground. Some are of a middle ſtature, theſe are the <hi>Calamus and Cinamon.</hi> (Trees of about two Cubits high.) Some are tall and eminent in
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:63179:162"/>
Grace, theſe are the <hi>trees of Frankincenſe, Myrrh</hi> and <hi>Aloes;</hi> trees of different growth, and yet all of the Lords planting. Some are <hi>Lambs,</hi> and ſome are <hi>Sheep,</hi> and yet all are of the ſame flock of Chriſt. Shall any one then ſay, I have no Grace becauſe I have not ſo much as another? Is not thy faith true faith, becauſe it is not ſo ſtrong as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams,</hi> who <hi>againſt hope believed in hope?</hi> or wilt thou queſtion the truth of thy obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, becauſe thou canſt not offer thy Son as he did? May not God be thy God, though thou canſt not call him as <hi>David</hi> did,<note place="margin">Pſal. 43.4.</note> 
                  <hi>God my exceeding joy?</hi> wilt thou deny the truth of thy dependance, becauſe thou haſt not the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> aſſurance? mayſt not thou be under the ſanctifying work of the ſpirit as well as he, though thou haſt not the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing work of the ſpirit as he had? though the ſpirit is <hi>magnus in magnis,</hi> as <hi>Austin</hi> ſays, yet he is not <hi>parvus in minimis;</hi> though his work be great in ſome of his children, yet it is not little in any; and therefore is to be owned in all. Shall a Child deny its being becauſe it is not a Man? the great <hi>Oak</hi> was once a <hi>little Plant,</hi> nay a ſmall <hi>Acorn.</hi> The bleſſing on man in the firſt Creation, was, <hi>increaſe and multiply:</hi> In the ſecond it is, <hi>grow in grace;</hi> ſo that it ſhall grow, for <hi>there is a bleſſing in it.</hi> And therefore for believers to compare themſelves with Saints of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt attainments, and to make thoſe things to be a meaſure of the <hi>truth</hi> of Grace, which are evidences of Grace in its <hi>growth</hi> and
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:63179:163"/>
                  <hi>ſtrength,</hi> this is a falſe meaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Another falſe rule of judging by, is much corruption; becauſe they find much filthineſs in their natures, ſtrong luſts ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring within, and too often breaking out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to actual ſins, therefore they conclude they have no Grace. Now this is a falſe rule to judge by. For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, There is no believer but by this rule would condemn his own ſtate. For where is that man that hath not much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling ſin, which too often breaks out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to actual ſin? indwelling luſt may be morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in ſome more than in others, and the habits of corruption more weakned, but yet there is much in the beſt. Look on <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> a great believer, the Father of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and yet how much ſin did he diſcover, once in <hi>Egypt,</hi> Geneſ. 12.13. another time in <hi>Gerar,</hi> Geneſ. 20.2. Look on <hi>Moſes</hi> a man of great Grace, and yet how much doth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption break forth; in that fourth chapter of <hi>Exodus,</hi> what unbelief doth he diſcover, what plea's to excuſe his unwillingneſs to go on Gods errand.<note place="margin">Exod. 3.11. Exod. 4.1. Exod. 4.10. Exod. 4.13. V. 14.</note> One while, <hi>who am I that I ſhould go to Pharaoh?</hi> another while, <hi>they will not believe me;</hi> then <hi>I am not eloquent;</hi> at laſt, <hi>ſend by whom thou wilt ſend;</hi> as much as to ſay, I will not go; ſo that <hi>the anger of the Lord was kindled againſt Moſes.</hi> The like you may ſee in <hi>Samſon,</hi> what corruption doth he diſcover, inſomuch that if the ſpirit of God had not put him into that Catalogue of believing worthies, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.32. you would
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:63179:163"/>
hardly have judged him one; and yet <hi>Samſon</hi> is recorded for a true Saint,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.39.</note> though he had much corruption.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God will not reject little Grace if it be true, where there is corruption though it be much. If there be but little Gold in the Ore and much droſs, yet the Refiner ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates the droſs and preſerves the Gold. It is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>his fan is in his hand;</hi> and what is the uſe of the <hi>fan,</hi> but to caſt out the chaff? the chaff is more than the wheat, but Chriſt will not ſuffer the leaſt grain of wheat to fall to the ground.<note place="margin">Amos 9.9.</note> Satan hath a <hi>ſieve</hi> in his hand and he <hi>ſifteth</hi> us; Chriſt hath a <hi>fan</hi> in his hand, and he <hi>fanneth</hi> us; now the uſe of the <hi>ſieve</hi> is to let out the beſt and keep in the worſt; the <hi>fan</hi> caſteth out the worſt and keepeth in the beſt. Satans work is to ſift us, <hi>Luk</hi> 22.31. <hi>Satan hath deſired to ſift you;</hi> that is, to countenance ſin and deſtroy Grace. But Jeſus Chriſt he fanneth us, that is, he purges corruption out of us, and nouriſhes and preſerves Grace in us; ſo then, though your Grace be never ſo little, it ſhall be preſerv'd, and though your corruption be never ſo much, it ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. And therefore,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, You ought to be humbled under ſin, and make it matter of mourning, but not to deny your Grace though under much and great ſin. There is a great deal in ſin to humble us; it diveſts us of our ſpiritual pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, it ſpoils our communion with God, that ſhould be matter of humbling; it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honours
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:63179:164"/>
honours God, and grieves the ſpirit, that ſhould be matter of humbling; it defiles the ſoul and wounds the conſcience, that ſhould be matter of humbling; but though every ſin ought to be bewailed, yet our ſtate is not therefore to be condemned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Another falſe rule of judging is by the frame of their hearts; becauſe upon ſearch they find their hearts dead, carnal, liſtleſs to duty, wandring from, or diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in duty, hence they give it againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and judge their ſtate carnal becauſe the frame of their heart is ſo. And no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that it is ſo (though it ought not to be ſo) if you do but conſider three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The goodneſs of a believers ſtate will give him no acceptance with God in any du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, unleſs the frame of the heart be right in it. A carnal frame ſhall do more to ſpoil a duty, than a ſpiritual ſtate can do to give it acceptance; this is moſt evident by that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29, 30. <hi>He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>to himſelf:</hi> There is a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs of ſtate, and a worthineſs of frame; now every believer hath a worthineſs of ſtate, in an Evangelical ſenſe for every ordinance, and therefore for the Lords Supper; but yet he may be unworthy in regard of the frame of his heart; and where it is ſo, an unworthy frame ſhall do more to bring judgment, than a worthy ſtate can do to prevent it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid in the next verſe, <hi>for this cauſe many are weak and ſick among you, and many ſleep.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:63179:164"/>2. God may carry it to a believer under a carnal frame of ſpirit in duties, as if he were no believer; when he comes to God in a carnal frame, God may carry it to him as if he were in a carnal ſtate, he may ſhut his ear and reject his ſervices.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A believer may injoy as little peace when the frame of his heart is not right, as if the ſtate of his ſoul were not right; for it is common with ſuch a one to judge of his ſtate by the frame of his heart. If his heart be dead and carnal, he judges his ſtate to be a dead carnal ſtate; but this ought not to be, for by this rule he will be forced to condemn himſelf a thouſand and a thouſand times o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, even as oft as he finds his heart out of frame. And where a believer judges his ſtate to be carnal, he can enjoy no more of the peace of his ſtate (though it be ſpiritual) than if it were carnal. But this is a falſe rule to judge by, For</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> A carnal frame is one thing, and a carnal ſtate is another; many a man may be found under a very carnal frame, and yet his ſtate be ſpiritual and good. It was the caſe of Chriſts own Diſciples, therefore he tells them <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.3. <hi>Except ye be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and become as little children, ye ſhall not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the kingdom of Heaven.</hi> The Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were converted as to their ſtate, but yet they were in a carnal frame, for they were contending among themſelves about a temporal Kingdom, which they expected Chriſt would ſet up; and who ſhould be
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:63179:165"/>
greateſt in it; (ſo <hi>Mark</hi> explains it <hi>chap.</hi> 9.34.) therefore our Lord tells them, they ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a new converſion: they muſt be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their carnal frames, as well as from a carnal ſtate; hence you may learn, that a man may have a right to Heaven and yet be very unfit for it; there muſt be a double right, <hi>jus haereditarium,</hi> and <hi>aptitudinarium,</hi> a right of inheritance, and a right of fitneſs; in our firſt converſion we derive a <hi>right of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,</hi> for then our ſtate is changed; but a <hi>right of fitneſs</hi> lies in after converſions, by which our carnal frames are ſubdued. We need but one converſion as to the former, but we need many as to the latter.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe this (though the former cannot) is a converſion that may be loſt; a man may be in a quickned frame to day, and under deadneſs to morrow; he may be ſpiritual in this duty, and yet carnal in the next.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe it is a converſion that admits of degrees; a man cannot be leſs or more converted as to his ſtate, but as to his frame he may; there is no one believer more born of the ſpirit than another, and yet one believer may be more ſpiritual than another; and he that is ſo, yet conſidered as to the meaſure of ſpiritual mindedneſs which is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable, and which he is appointed and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto, may himſelf be ſaid to be carnal, and may be filled with complaints becauſe of the ſhortneſs of his attainment. This I
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:63179:165"/>
take to be the meaning of that complaint of the Apoſtle, <hi>I am carnal,</hi> Rom. 7.14. Doth he therein condemn his ſtate? no, that had been ſin. But he bewails the frame of his heart, that in ſuch a ſpiritual condition into which by Grace he was brought, he ſhould have in him ſuch a carnal diſpoſition and frame of ſpirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> A Believer is not to judge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by what is unfixed and mutable; for ſo the frame of the heart is; what more volatile and unſtable? now caught up to Heaven, anon ſunk down to the Earth:<note place="margin">Cant. 6.12.</note> now like the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots of Aminadab,</hi> agil and ſwift to run the way of Gods Commandments; anon like <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Chariots that drove heavily having their wheels took off:<note place="margin">Exod. 14.25.</note> or like the wheels in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Viſion, that ſometimes <hi>went,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezech. 1.21.</note> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>ſtood ſtill:</hi> one while the acts of Faith are high, another while giving way to Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. Oh how inconſtant are the frames of good mens hearts! look on <hi>David,</hi> and now his <hi>mountain ſtands ſtrong;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 30.7.</note> and the next word is, <hi>thou didſt hide thy face and I was troubled.</hi> At one time you ſhall find him rejoycing in God; at another, <hi>why art thou caſt down O my ſoul?</hi> was it not ſo with <hi>Peter?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 26. V. 35. V. 72.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord though I ſhould dye with thee, yet will I not deny thee.</hi> And by and by, <hi>I know not the man:</hi> ſo that he who judges himſelf by the frame of his ſpirit, will change the opinion of his ſtate as often as the frame of his heart changes. And therefore when you find your hearts dead and carnal, your duty is to make this matter of <hi>mourning,</hi>
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:63179:166"/>
but you ought not to make it matter of <hi>doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> You muſt pray, and ſtrive, and uſe all Gods means for the removing it, but you ought not to judge your ſtate by it, leſt you deny the Grace of God in you becauſe of it. This is another falſe rule of tryal. Many more I might inſtance in, but theſe may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to ſhew you how carnal and ignorant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are apt to misjudge their ſtate by falſe rules on the one hand, and how weak believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are apt to misjudge theirs by falſe rules on the other, and to caution you on both ſides.</p>
               <p>And now I come to ſhew you which is the true and right rule you are to judge your ſelves by, and that is, <hi>the word of God.</hi> I do not mean the <hi>moral Law,</hi> that is not a proper rule to try weak Grace and imperfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by, for that condemns for the leaſt ſin; <hi>Curſed is every one that continues not in all things written in the Law to do them,</hi> Galat. 3.10. The Law indeed is a rule to know ſin by; <hi>I had not known ſin but by the Law,</hi> Rom. 7.7. and to know our natural and undone eſtate by, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. It inlightens, convinces, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, condemns, and kills; but it is not a rule to judge our eſtate in Chriſt by, or the truth of our Grace by. For by the Law no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is Grace but what is perfect, nothing goes for obedience, though our ſincerity be <hi>never ſo great,</hi> if our failing be <hi>never ſo little.</hi> And therefore he that trys himſelf by this rule muſt needs condemn all the Grace of God in him as no Grace, becauſe it is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Grace; he muſt be continually torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:63179:166"/>
in his own ſpirit about his ſtate, becauſe the leaſt ſin ſubjects him to the wrath of God. A Believer is under the Law for <hi>conduct,</hi> but not for <hi>judgment;</hi> it is the guide of his <hi>path,</hi> but not the judge of his <hi>ſtate.</hi> The Believer is bound to obey it, but he is not to ſtand and fall by it. It is a rule of life, and for the ſubſtance of it, it is moral and eternal, and can no more be abrogated than the nature of good and evil can be altered. And therefore it obliges Believers as much as others, though upon other motives, and to other ends, for they are not to expect <hi>life</hi> and <hi>favour</hi> from it, nor fear the <hi>death</hi> and <hi>rigour</hi> that comes by it; the Law hath no power either to <hi>juſtifie</hi> a Believer or <hi>condemn</hi> him, and therefore can be no rule to try his ſtate by. We ſhould labour to live to the precepts of the Law, but try our ſtate by the rule of the Goſpel; for that is the rule we are to ſtand and fall by. And it is a comfortable rule, for in the ſenſe of it affections go for actions, and indeavours for performances; ſo that if our affections be real, and our indeavours ſincere, the rule adjuſts our ſtate, and gives us confidence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.</p>
               <p>The ready way to come to a right deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination about our condition, is wiſely to apply to our ſelves thoſe Characters and marks which the word lays down concerning ſtate and ſtate; for it deſcribes both the natural and ſpiritual man, it characterizes both a ſtate of Nature, and a ſtate of Grace; it ſhews by poſitive ſigns who are ſubjects to his
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:63179:167"/>
                  <hi>Yoke,</hi> or Rebels to his Government. So that it is eaſie for a man by a right uſe of this rule to make a judgment what his ſtate is. As a wicked man by applying the chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of the natural ſtate, may certainly know that he is out of Chriſt, an enemy to him, and that his condition is a loſt condition; <hi>for the works of the fleſh are manifeſt,</hi> Galat. 5.19. So would the good man but wiſely apply the marks of Grace to his own heart as he finds them laid down in the word, he might certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know that his ſtate is good; for the <hi>fruits of the ſpirit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 5.22.</note> are as manifeſt as the <hi>works of the fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As God is <hi>principium eſſendi,</hi> the cauſe of the being of Grace; ſo the word of God is <hi>principium cognoſcendi,</hi> the rule by which we judge of the truth of Grace; and therefore <hi>to the law and to the teſtimony,</hi> Iſai. 8.20. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>The commandment is a lamp, and the law is light,</hi> Prov. 6.22. as a lamp it is the guide of our way; as a light it is the tryal of our ſtate. And ſo the former verſe clears it, <hi>when thou goeſt, it ſhall lead thee,</hi> there it is a lamp to guide us; <hi>when thou awakeſt it ſhall talk with thee,</hi> there it is a rule to try us.</p>
               <p>Try your ſtate therefore by this rule, and believe nothing either for or againſt your ſelves, but according to the word of God. This is the rule God will try us by, and therefore we ſhould try our ſelves by it. The judgment of God concerning us will be according to the word, <hi>John</hi> 12.48. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. So ſhould ours be.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="309" facs="tcp:63179:167"/>But in making uſe of the word for a rule of tryal, it will be your wiſdom to obſerve theſe three directions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You muſt take negative and poſitive ſigns together; Many judge themſelves by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative ſigns only, and not by poſitive, but this is to deceive themſelves; for negative holineſs can never commend us to God, whoſe commands are poſitive as well as negative. A man may abſtain from that which is poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively evil, and yet be but negatively good. So did the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> Luke 18.11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In trying your ſelves by the word, you are not to look ſo much to the habit and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Grace in its being, as to the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and effects of Grace in its working; for properties beſt prove principles, and effects bear witneſs to their cauſes. That which <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes</hi> godlineſs is the habit and principle of Grace; but that which <hi>evidences</hi> godlineſs is the properties of it.<note place="margin">Formae nos latent.</note> We do not know the internal forms of things, but their natures become known by their properties and effects. Our knowledge is for the moſt part <hi>à poſteriori,</hi> from effects; the principles of Grace in us are not evident to us, but by the motions and effects of them in our ſouls and lives.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In judging your eſtate by the word, you are not to look for perfect ſigns in your ſelves, I mean ſuch as do exactly anſwer to the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Law; for theſe are not to be found in any Believer upon earth. And if we look for ſuch ſigns, we ſhall be ſo far from receiving any ſatisfaction concerning our ſtate,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:63179:168"/>
that the more we try, the more we ſhall diſtruſt; the more we prove our ſubjection to Chriſt, the more we ſhall diſapprove it. We are to look for true ſigns but not for perfect; for ſuch as are common to the weakeſt believer, not for ſuch as are above the ſtrongeſt. The leaſt grace diſcovered in a believer, if ſincere and true, is a ſure ſign of his good eſtate in Chriſt; though it be not enough to ſatisfy his <hi>deſire,</hi> yet it is enough to ſatisfy his <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> though it be not ſufficient to fill up his meaſure in Chriſt, yet it is a ſufficient ſign to make out the truth of his intereſt in Chriſt. And that is the ſeventh general rule laid down for the carrying on the tryal of our ſtate, that we be ſure to make uſe of a right rule.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> 8. As the word of God muſt be your rule, ſo Conſcience muſt apply it, and give teſtimony according to it; for the word of it ſelf proves nothing but as conſcience ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys it, and argues from it. The word doth no where ſay, this or that man is converted to Chriſt, is a child of God, and in a ſtate of ſalvation; no, but it deſcribes that ſtate to which ſalvation is promiſed; and then Conſcience evidences that to be our ſtate; and ſo infers a certainty of ſalvation from the word. The word lays down things in plain propoſitions, Conſcience makes the aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, and then draws the concluſion: The word ſays, <hi>Any man that is in Chriſt is a new creature;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.17.</note> there is the propoſition: now the good mans Conſcience (helped by the ſpirit as I ſhall ſhew anon) that makes the aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption;
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:63179:168"/>
thus, <hi>but I am in Chriſt;</hi> and then draws the concluſion, therefore I am a new creature. The word ſays, <hi>They that are Chriſts ſheep hear his voice and follow him:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 10.27.</note> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſays, <hi>but I hear his voice and follow him;</hi> and thence concludes, therefore <hi>I am one of Chriſts ſheep.</hi> And this is that wherein the true teſtimony of Conſcience doth conſiſt; in giving evidence according to the rule laid down, and by that either condemning or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitting. Hence that of the Apoſtle, <hi>He that believes on the ſon of God hath the witneſs in himſelf,</hi> 1 John 5.10. truly ſo hath the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever too; for Conſcience by the light of the word witneſſeth againſt him if he would but hear it. The word ſays, <hi>the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.9.</note> but ſays Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>Thou art unrighteous;</hi> and thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, <hi>therefore thou ſhalt not inherit the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi> And hence the Apoſtle ſpeaks of a condemning Conſcience, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.20. <hi>If our hearts condemn us.</hi> It witneſſeth in the ſinner to condemnation, and in the Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to juſtification.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. But you will ſay, if it be thus, why doth not every Believer know his own ſtate? why are they ſo often calling the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their ſtate into queſtion, and ſo full of doubts and fears about their condition? if they have a witneſſing Conſcience, why is it thus?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is poſſible they may have wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing Conſciences, and yet may know lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the goodneſs of their ſtate. For,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> They may not poſſibly be acquainted
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:63179:169"/>
with their own Conſciences, nor keep up a communion with their own hearts as they ought.<note place="margin">Pſal. 4.4.</note> It is no new thing for a good man to be a ſtranger to himſelf, who might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be ſatisfied from himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 14.14.</note>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> They may have Conſcience wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing to the goodneſs of their ſtate, and yet not credit the teſtimony. As a bad man is deaf to the teſtimony of his Conſcience when it witneſſeth againſt him, from the power of ſelf-love; ſo is a good man to the teſtimony of his conſcience when it witneſſeth for him, from the power of jealouſie and ſuſpicion. He can look forward to apprehend the right object, but can't look inward to apprehend his own act. He can believe the teſtimony of the word, but cannot believe the teſtimony of his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience though it ſpeaks according to the word; though he hath truly received Chriſt, yet he will not receive the teſtimony of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience witneſſing to his ſtate in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Many may have witneſſing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and yet Conſcience may not wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; its witneſſing act may for a time be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended; and this is frequently ſo. Partly from the contraction of new guilt; when ſin is committed, Conſcience is ſilenced; guilt ſpoils the teſtimony. Partly from the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of God; for Conſcience ſpeaks no peace to us, unleſs God ſpeak peace to that. And therefore it is very poſſible that a good man may not always know his own ſtate, and yet he may have the witneſs in himſelf. And would he but be careful to keep Conſcience
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:63179:169"/>
clean from guilt and defilement, and be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to attend to its teſtimony, he would quickly attain to ſatisfaction in his ſpiritual ſtate? for Conſcience purged and ſanctified is <hi>a faithful witneſs</hi> that <hi>will not lye,</hi> eſpecially when joyned in its teſtimony to that which is the great witneſs of all, and that is the ſpirit.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.16.</note> 
                  <hi>The ſpirit bears witneſs with our ſpirits that we are the Children of God.</hi> And that brings me to the laſt general rule to be obſerved in this tryal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> 9. The way to come to a true ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction about your ſtate, is, to call in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the ſpirit of God, beg his teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; for there is no witneſs like his. And that,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Whether ye look to the clearneſs of it; no teſtimony can be ſo full. It is ſuch a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony as removes all perplexing doubts and fears, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>;<note place="margin">Chryſoſt.</note> what room for queſtionings and heſitancies againſt the ſpirits teſtimony?<note n="*" place="margin">Culver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well's Whitt Stone, p. <hi>113.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Hereby we know that we dwell in him, and he in us, becauſe he hath given us of his ſpirit,</hi> 1 John 4.13. No witneſs ſo ſatisfying as this; if God ſhould ſend an Angel from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as he did to <hi>Daniel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 9.23.</note> to tell us we are <hi>greatly beloved,</hi> it would not be ſo full and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying as this.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is a ſure teſtimony, and that,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether you look to the object of his teſtimony, the work of God in the heart; he never witneſſes to the goodneſs of that ſtate where there is not a work of Grace wrought; and therefore to talk of comforts and raviſhing joys from the ſpirit, without a true converſion to Chriſt firſt wrought, is a
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:63179:170"/>
meet ſelf deluſion; the ſpirit of God hath no hand in it: and ſo to boaſt of the comforts of the ſpirit while we walk not in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the ſpirit, it is a meer pretence; there is no ſuch thing found among Chriſtians as this. The ſpirit witneſſes to his own work, and therefore cannot be deceived in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his teſtimony.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you look to the nature of the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, for it is the witneſs of him who is truth it ſelf, and therefore he is called <hi>the ſpirit of truth,</hi> John 16.13. the teſtimony that he gives to the goodneſs of a believers ſtate is infallible and certain.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is a prevailing teſtimony that bears down all the teſtimonies that can any way be brought againſt us. As the interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt in Heaven for us, prevails over all charges that are brought there againſt us; ſin may charge, and Satan may charge, and the Law may charge, but yet the interceſſion of Chriſt prevails againſt all, and ſilences all; <hi>Who is he that condemns? it is Chriſt that dyed, yea rather that is riſen again, who is at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh interceſſion for us,</hi> Rom. 8.34. So is the teſtimony of the ſpirit in the heart, a prevailing teſtimony; the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever hath many adverſaries, wicked men, whoſe tongues are ſet on fire of Hell, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, traducing of them, and ready to witneſs falſely againſt them. And Satan is not wanting to bring in new charges againſt them; but this bleſſed witneſs of the ſpirit in the heart, prevails againſt and carrys the Soul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="315" facs="tcp:63179:170"/>Fourthly, It is an abiding teſtimony, that laſts till teſtimonies ſhall be needed no more. There would be no need of witneſſes if things were clear, and not apt to be called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; but ſo it is with the work of God in the heart, it is ever and anon called in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and hence ariſes the need of the ſpirits teſtimony. There will be no need of this way of witneſs in Heaven, for there is no doubts, nor fears, nor calling our ſtate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to queſtion, but during the preſent ſtate it is neceſſary, for new hidings, and new tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and new ſinnings, will cauſe new doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and queſtionings concerning our ſtate; and therefore the teſtimony of the ſpirit ſhall abide, and out laſt all our doubts and fears.</p>
               <p>I know this teſtimony may be, and is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſuſpended; a good man may not have it at all times; it is rare that any one hath. Sometimes (nay too often) he ſins it away; ſometimes for wiſe ends God takes it away; for it is an arbitrary priviledge, but he that hath had it once really, ſhall never loſe it final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; though it may be ſuſpended, it ſhall never be totally loſt; for it is an abiding witneſs, and therefore he that hath it, is ſaid to he <hi>ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the day of redemption,</hi> Epheſ. 4.30. this ſealing is not to be taken for the regenerating work of the ſpirit, but for his witneſſing work; for it is a ſealing that follows after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving; <hi>After that ye believed ye were ſealed with that holy ſpirit of promiſe,</hi> Epheſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 1.13. and this ſeal ſhall never be broken off; it ſhall abide to the Day of redemption. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:63179:171"/>
above all things beg the teſtimony of the ſpirit concerning your condition; for neither the word of God, nor Conſcience can evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the goodneſs of our ſtate, without the witneſs of the ſpirit; nay, the higheſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Grace wrought in the heart, cannot of it ſelf be an evidence of the goodneſs of our ſtate without the ſpirits teſtimony; as Grace cannot act it ſelf without the ſpirits <hi>help,</hi> ſo nor can it evidence it ſelf with out the ſpirits <hi>light;</hi> as the being of Grace is from the work of the ſpirit <hi>renewing,</hi> ſo the evidence of Grace is from the work of the ſpirit <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing.</hi> And therefore in this work rely much upon the teſtimony of the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>And thus I have anſwered the queſtion more generally.</p>

               <p>Secondly, I come now to a particular and diſtinct anſwer to the queſtion, How a man may know that he is indeed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt.</p>

               <p n="1">1. By ſuch things that always precede it, and are antecedent to it, or cauſal of it.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:63179:171"/>2. By ſuch things as are the natural effects and conſequences of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> By ſuch things as are antecedent to it. For you muſt know that taking up Chriſts <hi>Yoke</hi> is not preſently done; it is not the next work of a carnal ſinner: there are many things to be done in him and upon him before this work can be done by him. No natural man as ſuch can bear Chriſts <hi>Yoke;</hi> it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, and that will appear in two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, There is a deficiency of ſtrength to it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is an utter enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a deficiency of ſtrength and power to it. Sin hath made ſuch a waſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the nature of man, that it is utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent to any good: and hence every duty is an intolerable burden, becauſe there is no ſtrength to bear it.

No ſinner can take up Chriſts <hi>Yoke,</hi> becauſe of a deficiency of ſtrength for it; there can be no obeying Chriſt but by a ſtrength received from Chriſt, <hi>Surely ſhall one ſay in the Lord I have righteouſneſs and ſtrength.</hi>

to God and Chriſt; and therefore it is the uſual phraſe of Scripture to call ſinners Gods enemies. <hi>Rule thou in the midſt of thine enemies,</hi> Pſal. 110.2. <hi>Thine arrows are ſharp in the heart of the Kings enemies,</hi> Pſal. 45.5. <hi>Thoſe mine enemies, that would not I ſhould reign over them,</hi> Luke 19.27. <hi>When we were enemies we were reconciled to God,</hi> Rom. 5.10. The Covenant and friendſhip that was at firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and man being broken by ſin, an enmity muſt needs enſue upon it. It is the buſineſs and deſign of ſin to make and keep enmity between God and the creature, and mark how the Apoſtle demonſtrates the truth of this enmity in natural man to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. <hi>The carnal mind is enmity againſt God, for it is not ſubject to the Law of God, nor indeed can be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not ſubject, and it cannot be ſubject to the Law of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is not ſubject to the Law of God, and this is a plain conviction that there is an enmity. That which oppoſes God, and the Law and rule of God in the heart, what is that but enmity? for as friendſhip conſiſts moſt properly in willing and nilling the ſame things<note n="*" place="margin">Idem vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, &amp; idem nolle, eſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra amici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia.</note>; ſo enmity doth moſt properly conſiſt in an oppoſition of will, in willing and nil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the contrary. So that for the will of man to lye contrary to the Law of God is an undeniable proof of enmity againſt him. Who were they that ſaid, <hi>Let us break his bands, and caſt away his cords from us?</hi> Pſal. 2.3. He tells you verſe 2. they were
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:63179:172" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſuch as <hi>ſet themſelves against the Lord and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Chriſt.</hi> And are not they enemies?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As it is not ſubject, ſo the carnal mind <hi>cannot be ſubject to the Law of God.</hi> And why? for five reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe of the blindneſs of the mind; ſin hath put out that light that ſhould guide the ſoul, and conduct it to God. A dark mind is ever accompanied with a diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent heart. <hi>There is none that underſtands,</hi> Rom. 3.11. and what follows? <hi>They are all gone out of the way.</hi> So Epheſ. 4.18. <hi>Having the underſtanding darkned, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them.</hi> He that hath nothing of the <hi>light</hi> of God, can have nothing of the <hi>life</hi> of God; and where there is no ſharing in the life of God, there can be ſubjection to the Law of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe of the corruption that is in the will, which ſets it againſt every thing of God. <hi>We will not that this man reign over us,</hi> Luke 19.14.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is from the diſorderedneſs of the affection, they are all depraved, no love for God; and where there is no love to God, there can be no ſubjection to the Law of God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Becauſe of the ſpirituality of the Law of God; <hi>The Law is ſpiritual,</hi> ſays <hi>Paul, but I am carnal,</hi> Rom. 7.14. And what he ſpeaks of his frame, is true of the natural mans ſtate, it is carnal; and how can a heart that is carnal be ſubject to a Law that is ſpiritual?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Becauſe it is under the prevailing
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:63179:173"/>
power of a contrary Law, the Law of ſin and luſt rules in every carnal heart; they are under the Dominion of ſin, and therefore cannot be ſubject to the Law of God; theſe are the two Maſters that our Lord Chriſt ſays no man can ſerve, <hi>Matt.</hi> 6.24.</p>
               <p>Every natural man is wholly under the power of ſin, and how then can he be ſubject to the Law of God? And if he cannot be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Law of God, then much leſs can he be ſubject to the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt. If the carnal mind hath an enmity to the former, it muſt needs have a greater enmity to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; becauſe the Law of Chriſt lies more contrary to his inclinations than the Law of God doth. The Law of God was once writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the natural mans heart, the Law of Chriſt never was; there are ſome notions of the Law of God ſtill left in the heart, and ſomewhat in every man that doth leſs or more ſide with it, and lead to it. But there are no notions of Chriſt, nothing in man that dictates the leaſt duty with reſpect to Chriſt and the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>So that you ſee plainly it is not the ſinners next work to take up Chriſts <hi>Yoke.</hi> He muſt firſt be prepared for it, for till then he will never be brought to a free and full ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Jeſus Chriſt. It is the diſpoſition of man never to come to Chriſt but at ſecond hand; no man comes to Chriſt firſtly and immediately, till he comes under ſome ſuch preparations as carry conſtraint and compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in them.<note place="margin">Luk. 14.23.</note> 
                  <hi>Compel them to come in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="321" facs="tcp:63179:173"/>Though the ſoul when it doth come, it comes freely; it is a free act of the will; there is no forcing a ſinner to come to Chriſt againſt his will; if he comes it muſt be freely; yet he is always compell'd to come before he doth come: <hi>Jacobs</hi> Sons went down freely into <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> yet they were under a great compulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Famine drove them. The <hi>Prodigal</hi> returned moſt freely to his Fathers houſe; and yet he was under compulſion, he muſt have ſtarved elſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.17, 18. <hi>I periſh with hunger, I will ariſe and go to my Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will ariſe and go;</hi> there he comes freely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I periſh with hunger;</hi> there is the compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>None ever came to Chriſt meerly upon the tender of Chriſt, but as under ſome compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; now what is that which compells a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, one that hath been a blind ſinner, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling ſinner, to come to Chriſt and take up his <hi>Yoke?</hi> they are thoſe preparatory works which are done upon the heart of a ſinner by Chriſt and his ſpirit; till which, no ſinner ever doth or can ſubmit to him, or own him.</p>
               <p>Now I ſhall reduce theſe works, which I call preparatory for ſubjection to Chriſt, to three heads, and ſpeak a little diſtinctly to each of them, that ſo you may know how to make uſe of them in the tryal of your ſtate.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, The enlightening the mind.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, The convincing the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>The third is, The inclining the will.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:63179:174"/>1. There is a ſaving illumination of the mind. There can be no coming to Chriſt out of the darkneſs of a natural ſtate, till the light of God break in to ſhew us the way. Spiritual things cannot be diſcerned by natural light. <hi>The natural man receives not the things of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.14.</note> 
                  <hi>for they are fooliſhneſs to him; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he know them becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> The object is ſupernatural, God in Chriſt, and the myſteries of the Kingdom; and therefore cannot be diſcern'd but by a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural light;<note place="margin">Pſal. 36.9.</note> 
                  <hi>In thy light we ſhall ſee light.</hi> By nature we know little of God, but nothing of Chriſt,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.6.</note> or the mind of Chriſt, till <hi>God who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs ſhine into our hearts.</hi> The firſt creature that God made in the World was light, and the firſt work of God in the ſoul is light. The will of man is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a rational appetite; it is acted by the guidance of the mind, and therefore God deals firſt with the mind and underſtanding of man. And hence it is that Chriſt is made a <hi>Prophet</hi> as well as a <hi>King:</hi> he doth not ſubdue the will meerly by an unaccountable power, but by a ſaving light.</p>
               <p>And becauſe the mind muſt firſt be inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this work, therefore Chriſt firſt appears in the office of a <hi>Prophet;</hi> not only revealing the will of God, as a rule of obedience, but inlightening the mind to ſee the reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of complying with the rule. He doth not only bring light <hi>unto the ſoul</hi> by the revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word, but he brings light <hi>into the
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:63179:174"/>
ſoul</hi> by the communication of his ſpirit. <hi>We have received the ſpirit of God that we may know the things that are freely given to us of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.22.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This I call a ſaving illumination; for that light which the Lord works in ſuch as are brought home to Chriſt, is of a ſaving nature, and hath ſaving effects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is in its own nature as ſaving as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Grace in the will or affections; for it is a work of the ſame ſpirit, and wrought for the ſame end, to bow the ſoul to Chriſt. It is an eſſential part of that Image of God after which we are renewed, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.10. <hi>And have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge, after the image of him that created him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that this light differs not only gradually but ſpecifically from the higheſt light that is in hypocrites and formal profeſſors. A hypocrite may have much notional knowledge, great meaſures of light in ſpiritual things, from the common work of the ſpirit; but in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree of it, it is not ſaving; for as to ſaving light, ſo he is in darkneſs until now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It hath ſaving operations and effects, and that both as to believing and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying.</p>
               <p>Firſt, As to believing. <hi>They ſhall all be taught of God, and what then?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 6.45.</note> 
                  <hi>every man that hears and learns of the father, comes to me.</hi> This coming to Chriſt is believing; and this believing is the fruit of Gods teaching, ſo that this is a ſaving operation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As to obedience. As it is ſaid of the two blind men whom Chriſt cured, that
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:63179:175"/>
                  <hi>as ſoon as they had received their ſight, ſtraight way they aroſe and followed him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 20.34.</note> 
                  <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>the ſun ariſes and man goes out to his labour till the evening,</hi> Pſal. 104.22, 23. when the ſun of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ariſes in the heart, it is ſo. So that this is a ſaving operation.</p>
               <p>Now let this be a rule of tryal for young ones; have you been prepared for ſubjection to Chriſt by a ſaving illumination? do you know any thing of being <hi>called out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs into his marvelous light?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet 2.9.</note> can you ſay, I <hi>was blind,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 9.25.</note> 
                  <hi>but now I ſee?</hi> the ſoul that is ſavingly inlightened, it ſees that in ſin it never ſaw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it ſees that in Chriſt it never ſaw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. That ſoul is far from the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt, that was never inlightened with the <hi>light</hi> of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing is the convincing of the conſcience. Where the ſoul is brought to take up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt, it is the fruit of through convictions. There muſt be a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold conviction wrought upon the ſinner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever he will ſtoop to Chriſt. A convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction <hi>of ſin,</hi> a conviction <hi>of righteouſneſs,</hi> and a conviction <hi>of judgment,</hi> this is through conviction; and all conviction ſhort of this leaves the ſoul ſhort of Chriſt. And therefore when ever the ſpirit of God comes to convince the ſoul to converſion, he convinces of all theſe, as you ſee <hi>John</hi> 16 8. <hi>When he is come he will convince the world of ſin, and of righteouſneſs, and of judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> He <hi>convinces of ſin.</hi> This is the next end of illumination. He ſets up a light to ſee
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:63179:175"/>
ſin, and then applys the guilt of ſin to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: for though a man lies under the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite guilt of ſin, and the dreadful wrath of God for it, yet till the ſpirit of God do ſet this home upon a mans Conſcience, he never ſees his condition, nor conſiders with himſelf what to do. No, it is the being pricked at heart that cauſes this, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. <hi>When they heard this they were pricked in their heart;</hi> and what then? then they cry out, <hi>men and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren what ſhall we do?</hi> And therefore the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit firſt deals with a man about his ſins; ſo he did to the firſt ſinners, he opens their eyes to ſee their nakedneſs and ſhame, their ſin and miſery, before the <hi>ſeed of the woman</hi> is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.<note place="margin">Gen. 3.10.15.</note> There is one inſtance inſtead of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, and that is of <hi>Paul;</hi> I call it ſo, becauſe he tells you that Jeſus Chriſt ſet him up for a pattern in his dealing with ſinners.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.16.</note> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore look how Chriſt dealt with him to bring him under his <hi>Yoke,</hi> and ſo he deals with all.</p>
               <p>Now the firſt great work upon <hi>Paul</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of ſin. The Spirit of Chriſt by the word, ſet ſin home upon his Conſcience, and there the work began. This is meant by the coming of the Commandment, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9 <hi>When the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment came, ſin revived and I dyed.</hi> You may ſee it more particularly expreſſed in <hi>Acts</hi> 9.3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>There ſhined round about him a light from heaven, and he fell to the earth, and heard a voice ſaying to him, Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me? and he ſaid, who art thou Lord? and the Lord ſaid, I am Jeſus whom thou perſecuteſt, it is hard for thee to kick againſt the pricks. And he
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:63179:176"/>
trembling and aſtoniſhed ſaid, Lord, what wilt thou have me do?</hi> Here's a light and a voice; <hi>there ſhined a light from heaven, and he heard a voice;</hi> this did the work. Here's illumination and conviction. The <hi>light</hi> makes the blind eye to ſee, and the <hi>voice</hi> makes the deaf ear to hear. The voice comes through the light. And what ſays the voice? <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt thou me? I am Jeſus whom thou perſecuteſt.</hi> There are two things in this voice.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It ſingles out the perſon, and applies guilt in a particular manner. <hi>Saul, Saul, why doſt thou perſecute me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, It ſingles out a particular ſin, and that is his perſecuting Chriſt in his Saints. And upon this the conviction ſticks, and fills him with terrour; he falls a <hi>trembling</hi> and is <hi>aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,</hi> and crys out, <hi>Lord what wilt thou have me to do?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now pray mind; the manner of Chriſt's dealing with <hi>Paul</hi> was exemplary; it was to be a pattern. He tells us ſo, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16. <hi>For this cauſe I obtained mercy, that in me first Jeſus Chriſt might ſhew forth all long-ſuffering for a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern to them which ſhould hereafter believe.</hi> It is as if he ſhould ſay, look how God dealt with me; ſingled me out, ſtopped me in the heat of my wickedneſs, applyed guilt particularly to me, and ſo made me ſee my ſelf loſt: So he will deal with all ſuch ſinners as he brings home to Chriſt. I am ſet up for a pattern.</p>
               <p>So then there are theſe two things in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction as we may learn from this patern.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A ſingling out the perſon, charging ſin
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:63179:176"/>
particularly; thou art the man. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed where conviction of ſin is throughly wrought, the word is as particularly apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſoul as it was to <hi>Saul,</hi> when it called him by name; and it is this that is called the <hi>coming of the commandment.</hi> It comes home, and ſingles out the ſinner, as if it ſaid, thou <hi>Thomas,</hi> thou <hi>John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There is in conviction moſt commonly a ſetting home ſome particular ſin upon the Conſcience. For we ſay <hi>Generalia non pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunt;</hi> convictions don't lye in a general charge. Indeed in the progreſs of the work all ſin is ſet home:<note place="margin">Iſai. 4.4.</note> for the ſpirit is <hi>a ſpirit of judgment,</hi> and therefore every ſin muſt come under the judgment of the ſpirit. He holds the glaſs of the Law before the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners eyes till he makes him ſee all; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſins that break out, but the luſt that is within; not only the wickedneſs of his life, but the plague of his heart, and the ſin of his nature. But yet he firſt begins with ſome particular ſin. And uſually (though the methods of the ſpirit are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in very various) he begins with ſome chief ſin.</p>
               <p>Thus when Chriſt would deal effectually with the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> he begins with that which was her chief ſin, her living in Adultery;<note place="margin">John 4.18.</note> 
                  <hi>The man thou now haſt is not thy husband.</hi> Thou haſt had five Husbands, and yet after all thou liveſt in Adultery. This word ſtruck her to the heart, and by this ſhe was led into a ſight of all her ſins; for ſaid ſhe (<hi>v.</hi> 29) <hi>Come ſee a man
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:63179:177"/>
that told me all that ever I did.</hi> Thus he dealt with thoſe Jews, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.23, 37. and thus with <hi>Paul</hi> as I ſhewed you. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is admirable wiſdom and grace in this.</p>
               <p>That ſin which is a mans chief ſin he will ſtick faſteſt to, and part with all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſave the life of that; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the work of conviction is never effectual till a man be made throughly ſenſible of that.</p>
               <p>Beſides, that ſin that a man loves moſt, he will act moſt, and that wounds Chriſt moſt. Now the ſpirit takes that arrow that wounds the heart of Chriſt moſt, and makes it fall upon the head of the ſinner that ſhot it againſt him. Thus God happily out-ſhoots us in our own bow, whilſt the arrows of our ſins that wound Chriſt's heart, are taken and made the <hi>arrows of the almighty</hi> to ſtick in us and <hi>drink up our ſpirits.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 6.4.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This is the uſual way of the Lord. Nor can it be proved out of the Scripture that any who have arrived at capable years, have ever been called home to Chriſt any other way than by conviction of ſin firſt. It may be with ſome it hath been in a more ſecret and gentle way; or it may be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy hath been propounded together with the diſcovery of the malady; ſo that ſome have not been able to diſtinguiſh of things: yet this doth no way enervate the truth of what we affirm.</p>
               <p>And though we read in Scripture of ſome that were effectually brought into Chriſt,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:63179:177"/>
whoſe convictions we read nothing of; as <hi>Lydia,</hi> and <hi>Zacheus,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Nortons Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt. p. <hi>139.</hi>
                  </note> yet it doth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow that they were not convinced of ſin before their receiving Chriſt, becauſe their convictions are not mentioned. It muſt neceſſarily be ſuppoſed, for that no man can cloſe with Chriſt without a ſight of the need of him; and no man can ſee the need of Chriſt with a ſight and ſenſe of ſin. <hi>They that be whole need not a Phyſician but the ſick.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 9.12.</note> And Chriſt ſays,<note place="margin">V. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>he came not to call the righteous but ſinners to repentance,</hi> that is, ſenſible ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.<note place="margin">Iſai. 40.3.</note> This is that which <hi>prepares the way of the Lord</hi> into the ſoul, and <hi>makes ſtrait in the deſart a high way for our God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here then you have another rule to try your ſelves by. Have you ever been prepared for a cloſe with Chriſt by a through convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſin? hath the Spirit of the Lord been at work in your hearts? have you ever felt the commandment come with power? have you ever been made to ſee your ſelves loſt? thus it hath been leſs or more with all that are brought to take up. Chriſts <hi>Yoke;</hi> convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſin muſt firſt make us weary of ſins <hi>Yoke,</hi> before ever we can take up Chriſts <hi>Yoke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Nor is this enough to bring the ſoul to Chriſt; but there muſt be a <hi>conviction of righteouſneſs,</hi> as well as of ſin; or elſe the work would be ſpoiled, and to no purpoſe, ſave to bring the ſoul to deſpondency. The ſpirit would not only be a ſpirit of <hi>bondage</hi> but a ſpirit of <hi>deſpair;</hi> and therefore he doth
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:63179:178"/>
not only convince of ſin, but alſo of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; both of the need the ſinner hath of it, and of the fulneſs of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Of the ſinners need of it. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed when a man is thus ſick, it is eaſy to ſhew him the need of a Phyſician. Only the miſery is, we are apt to uſe wrong remedies. When a diſeaſe is deſperate we run to ſuch Phyſicians as are next; like the poor <hi>woman with her bloody iſſue,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mark. 5.25.</note> runs from one Phyſician to another, and what is ſhe the near? why the iſſue of her purſe was dryed up, but not her iſſue of blood; <hi>ſhe ſpent all ſhe had upon them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">V. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>and yet grew worſe.</hi> And it will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be ſo in theſe maladies; no created me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine ſhall avail in that diſeaſe, which Chriſt himſelf will have the honour of curing. And therefore purpoſes, reſolutions, legal repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, ſelf righteouſneſs, and all ſelf deviſed means which the ſinner is wont to run to for eaſe in this caſe,<note place="margin">Job 6.20.</note> ſhall be in vain and to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>This is another degree of the ſpirits work, whereby <hi>all the proud helpers do ſtoop under him,</hi> as it is <hi>Job</hi> 9.13. he makes him ſee himſelf loſt, and no help at hand; that ſo he may go for help where God hath laid it;<note place="margin">Pſal. 89.19.</note> 
                  <hi>I have laid help upon one that is mighty.</hi> And indeed nothing ſo convinces the ſoul of the need of Chriſts righteouſneſs, as the experienced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency and emptineſs of all other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. <hi>Then ſhall they know that I am the Lord,</hi> when is that? <hi>when all her helpers ſhall be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi> Ezek. 30.8. And for a poor thirſty ſoul
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:63179:178"/>
to find all brooks dryed up and failing, oh what would he then give for one draught of this living water?</p>
               <p>Secondly, He convinces of the fulneſs of this righteouſneſs, that there is enough in it to juſtify and ſave the vileſt of ſinners that lay hold of it. For it is an infinite righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo that no ſin can exceed it; and it is an everlaſting righteouſneſs, ſo that no ſin can waſt it. And indeed there is nothing becomes a more ſutable incouragement to a ſoul made empty, and naked, and ſtript off all, than to ſee a fulneſs of righteouſneſs in a Redeemer. For that is the firſt queſtion an undone ſinner makes about Chriſt. What is he? what hath he done? what is the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his blood? is he able to ſave and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ſuch an undone wretch as I am? ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice I dread, but can't ſatisfy it: mercy I need, but can't merit it: I have an unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable burden of guilt, but can't remove it: can Chriſt remove this curſe, and make my peace with God? can he be a City of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge to me from that avenger of blood that purſues me?</p>
               <p>Now in anſwer to all theſe ſolicitous inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of a ſoul diſtreſſed by ſin, <hi>the ſpirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of righteouſneſs;</hi> of the infinite fulneſs and ſatisfactorineſs of it, by an undeniable argument, for that it hath ſatisfied the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite juſtice of God, as appears evidently in this, that <hi>he is gone to the Father,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 16.10.</note> 
                  <hi>and ye ſee him no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here then you have another rule to try by;
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:63179:179"/>
they that have taken up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt, are ſuch as have been made to ſee the need of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt. That this, and none but this can ſtead the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Now pray conſider, have you that are young ever been convinced of <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</hi> may be you have been convinced of ſin; alas, what is that without this? you have felt the wound, but have found no plaiſter: and however you have skinned it, it is far from healing. Have you ever been made to ſee the need, the fulneſs of Chriſts <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs?</hi> that your <hi>all</hi> as to life and hope lies there? that this <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> hath ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the law of God for you? that this <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> hath ſatisfyed the juſtice of God which you could never have done? that this <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> hath not only redeemed you from Hell, but hath purchaſed for you all Grace and Glory; Grace here and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in Heaven? and that this is the <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> you muſt be found in, if ever you are taken into favour with God? this is the true notion of being <hi>convinced of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Now what do you experience of this work of the ſpirit? for let me tell you, it is not enough to be convinced of <hi>ſin,</hi> but it muſt be of <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> alſo: this is as needful as that to bring you to Chriſt. Many are convinced of <hi>ſin,</hi> and what do they under ſuch convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? why they betake themſelves to repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and hearing, and praying, and reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and then think the wound is healed, and their ſtate ſafe. Ah poor creatures! this
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:63179:179"/>
(though good in its deſigned and appointed uſe) if this be all they have to truſt to, it is as ſurely a way of periſhing as any other. Why then do ſo many betake themſelves to this way, and reſt in it? alas it is becauſe they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were convinced of <hi>righteouſneſs;</hi> and they that were never convinced of the <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> of Chriſt, never yet took up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Nor is this enough to bring the ſoul into ſubjection to Chriſt, to convince it of <hi>ſin,</hi> and then of <hi>righteouſneſs;</hi> but it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of <hi>judgment</hi> too. What is that you'l ſay? not to meddle with the various ſenſes that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers give of it. By <hi>judgment</hi> here I underſtand the work of grace and ſanctification in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever. And indeed I ſee not how any other of thoſe ſenſes that are commonly put upon it can ſo well agree with it as this: for the office of the ſpirit here is to carry on the work of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction ſo as to put honour upon Jeſus Chriſt in all his offices. In <hi>convincing of ſin</hi> he puts ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour upon him as a Prophet; in <hi>convincing of righteouſneſs</hi> he puts honour upon him as a Prieſt dying for ſin; and in <hi>convincing of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> he puts honour upon him as a King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing and working Grace in the heart. And the Holy Ghoſt uſes the ſame word in the ſame ſenſe elſewhere. As in <hi>Matt.</hi> 12.20. <hi>A bruiſed reed ſhall he not break, and ſmoaking flax ſhall he not quench, till he ſend forth judgment to victory,</hi> till the work of ſanctification be prevalent over all luſts and corruptions. So that by <hi>judgment</hi> the work of ſanctification is intended; and the following words clear it,<note place="margin">John 16.11.</note> for then <hi>the Prince of this world
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:63179:180"/>
is judged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> And indeed there is as great need of conviction of <hi>judgment</hi> as there is either of <hi>ſin</hi> or <hi>righteouſneſs:</hi> for if a man be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of <hi>ſin,</hi> he will never be weary of it: if he be not convinced of <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> he will never ſeek it: and if he be not convinced of <hi>holineſs,</hi> he will never labour after it. When once a man is convinced of <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> the next work is believing in Chriſt: and when once he is convinced of <hi>holineſs,</hi> the next work is taking up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whereever any ſoul is brought to take up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt, it is the fruit of the ſpirits work convincing of the neceſſity of holineſs.</p>
               <p>So then here is another rule of tryal. They that have taken up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt, are ſuch as have been made to ſee a neceſſity of holineſs as well as of righteouſneſs. That it is not enough to be pardoned, and to have their perſons accepted; but they muſt be changed, their natures renewed. Indeed no man will take up Chriſts <hi>Yoke</hi> without ſuch a conviction as this. Convince him of <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and then he will ſeek to be ſaved by Chriſt; but if he be not convinced of the neceſſity of <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> he will never be brought to obey Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Many a man is convinced of <hi>ſin,</hi> and yet not convinced of <hi>righteouſneſs;</hi> that man ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver comes to Chriſt. And many are convinced of <hi>ſin,</hi> and of <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> and yet are not convinced of <hi>judgment;</hi> theſe ſee the need of the blood of Chriſt to take away guilt, but they ſee no need of the Grace of Chriſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new their hearts; and theſe will never take up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt. But when the ſpirit
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:63179:180"/>
of the Lord carries on the work to a through conviction, both of <hi>ſin,</hi> and of <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> and of <hi>judgment,</hi> then it is that the ſoul is made wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to take up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt. And this brings me to the third preparatory work, whereby a man is fitted to take up this <hi>Yoke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The third thing is the inclining the will. There can be no taking up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt till this be done: for wherein lies our ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to Chriſt? but in a conſent of will to take him for our Lord as well as our Saviour; and yielding a ready obedience to his laws, as well as relying on his merits. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the moſt difficult part of converſion lies, to bring the will to a free ſubjection to Jeſus Chriſt. There is no part ſo vitiated and corrupted by the fall as the will. The blindneſs of the mind, the ſtupidneſs of the conſcience is not ſo great as the obſtinacy and rebellion of the will. By nature we are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſubject to no Law but the Law of the members; to no will but the will of the fleſh. <hi>Iſrael would none of me,</hi> Pſal. 81.11. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> had no will to me; <hi>We will not have this man to reign over us,</hi> Luk. 19.14. <hi>Ye will not come to me that ye might have life,</hi> John 5.40. <hi>It is not ſubject to the Law of God, nor indeed can be,</hi> Rom. 8.7. There is that enmity and oppoſition, that reluctancy and ſtoutneſs of ſpirit againſt Chriſt and his ways, ſuch proneneſs to evil, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſs to good, ſuch ſtrong prejudices, ſuch deep reaſonings, ſuch ſolicitations of Satan, ſuch downright rebellion, that a voluntary ſubjection to Chriſt is an impoſſible thing,<note place="margin">Pſal. 110.3.</note> till God puts forth the all conquering arm of his
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:63179:181"/>
power, and ſubdues the ſoul to himſelf.</p>
               <p>So deſperately bent is the heart of every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man againſt Chriſt, and ſo ſtrongly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the impulſion of indwelling luſt to vitious practices, that neither the promiſes of life and ſalvation can allure it, nor the threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Hell and Damnation deter it: no fear, nor hope, no danger, nor reward can ſtop it till an Almighty power do it. And therefore to talk of moral ſuaſions as ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſubdue and bring the will over to Chriſt, is an idle dream of ſuch as either ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver felt <hi>the day of Chriſts power</hi> in their own ſouls, or elſe contradict their own experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. There is no power can reach to pull a man out of the hands of his ſin, but the power of the ſpirit of God. As no man can convert himſelf, ſo no means can reach to do it; by the ſame reaſon that any one man periſheth in the enmity of his will to Chriſt and holineſs, all men would if left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; becauſe there is the ſame original enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the things of God in all as there is in any.</p>
               <p>And therefore the government of Chriſt in the ſoul is not by choice and conſent firſt had, but by power and conqueſt. As it was with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> God promiſeth them the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> for a poſſeſſion; but it was not a land uninhabited, that they might go and poſſeſs at pleaſure, without any more to do; no, but the <hi>Canaanites</hi> and the ſons of <hi>Anak</hi> dwelt there, and had it in poſſeſſion; and therefore if they will have it, they muſt fight their way into it. Thus it is here,<note place="margin">John 17.6.</note> the elect are Chriſts by <hi>donation,</hi> given to him by the Father; and his by right
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:63179:181"/>
of <hi>Redemption,</hi> for he dyed for them, and bought them with a price;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.20.</note> but yet Satan hath the poſſeſſion, and by the power of ſin and luſt detaineth Chriſts right; So that if Chriſt will be poſſeſſed of his right, it muſt be by conqueſt. And therefore his firſt entrance into the heart is by way of victory. Hence ye read of <hi>one ſitting upon a white horſe, with a Bow, and a Crown, and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.</hi> Rev. 6.2. This is the Lord Chriſt. He is ſaid to ſit upon <hi>a white horſe.] a horſe</hi> betokens war: <hi>a white horſe,</hi> betokens vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and triumph. And he is ſaid to have <hi>a Bow</hi> and <hi>a Crown,</hi>] the <hi>Bow</hi> is an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of war; the <hi>Crown</hi> is a token of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. The <hi>Bow</hi> ſtands before the <hi>Crown,</hi> to ſhew us that where-ever Chriſt reigns in any heart, it is by conqueſt and victory firſt obtained; The <hi>Bow</hi> makes way to the <hi>Crown.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Every Soul is firſt a Captive to Chriſt, before it is a Subject. <hi>Bringing into captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty every thought, to the obedience of Christ.</hi> 2 Cor. 10.5. VVe never ſubmit to his Scepter, till we are firſt overcome by his power. <hi>They ſhall be a willing people in the day of thy power.</hi> Pſal. 110.3. It is a mighty power that brings the ſinner to a ſubmiſſion and reſignedneſs of will to Chriſt. The Soul is firſt Captivated by his power, and then freely ſubmits to his termes. This Royal Fort of the will is never yielded up, nor the <hi>everlaſting doors</hi>
                  <pb n="338" facs="tcp:63179:182"/>
of the heart ſet open for <hi>the King of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> to come in, till his power makes way for his preſence: and therefore <hi>this King of glory</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>The Lord ſtrong and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Lord mighty in battel.</hi> Pſal. 24.8. It is his <hi>mightineſs</hi> makes him appear <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</hi> We ſhould never own him, nor open to him as King of glory, if we did not feel his might by way of victory. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes firſt makes his entrance as <hi>the Lord ſtrong and mighty,</hi> and then the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doors are ſet open to him to come in as <hi>King of glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that it is manifeſt that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt in the heart is firſt by way of conqueſt. Not that this is done by any violent compulſion (it implies a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction that the will can be compelled) but by a ſupernatural power ſweetly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper'd, in its manner of working, to the nature and diſpoſition of the will; whereby the obſtinacy is cured, the enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty taken away, and the will brought over to a free ſubmiſſion to Jeſus Chriſt. Thus <hi>God works in us to will.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 2.13.</note> So that it is an act of omnipotent Grace in regard of God; and yet the will hath ſtill the dominion of its own act. It is not forcibly compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but worketh by a ſelf-motion, to that to which it is actuated by the power of Divine Grace. And when the mind is thus ſavingly inlightened, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience effectually convinced, and the will by the powerful quickening of God ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:63179:182"/>
framed for a full conformity and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the divine will, then is a man throughly prepared and fitted to take up the <hi>yoke</hi> of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And this is one way by which you may make a judgment in this matter. If the mind hath been ſavingly inlightened. If the Conſcience hath been effectually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of <hi>ſin,</hi> of <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> and of <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> And if the will, by a powerful touch of God, hath been throughly ſubdued to the Divine Will, then are you brought under the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt. And this is a judgment, <hi>a priori,</hi> by ſuch things as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways precede an actual ſubjection to Chriſt, and are cauſal of it.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="2">2. WE may make a judgment <hi>a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriori.</hi> By ſuch marks and ſigns as are the natural ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and proper fruits of ſubjection to Chriſt. Effects bear witneſs to their cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; the reflection of the Sun-beams up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth proves its ſhining, without looking upward. And this, to weak and leſs diſcerning Chriſtians, may be the moſt proper meaſures to try their State by. VVho deſires a better proof of Life then Senſe and Motion? or better Knowledge of a Tree then by its Fruits? if the Tree be good,<note place="margin">Mat. 7.20.</note> the Fruit will be good. <hi>By their Fruits ye ſhall know them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now there are two things which are the conſtant effects, and natural fruits of this <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt; and they are, dying to ſin, and living to God. Putting off the old man, and putting on the new. Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying the Fleſh, and Sowing to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. And where ever a man is brought into ſubjection to Jeſus Chriſt, theſe are the inſeparable effects of it by which it may be known.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="341" facs="tcp:63179:183"/>Firſt then, take the temper and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the heart towards ſin for a rule of tryal. He that bears Chriſts <hi>Yoke,</hi> will no longer bear ſins <hi>Yoke.</hi> VVhere the one is once put on, the other is dayly putting off. There is an irreconcileable odds, in every man that is under the power of grace to ſin and luſt, and it appeares</p>
               <p n="1">1. In ſearching out of ſin, <hi>let us ſearch and try our ways.</hi> Though a good man knows much evil by himſelf, yet he deſires to know more. Though he ſees many luſts and corruptions in his heart, yet he is ſenſible that there are many he ſees not; for <hi>who can underſtand his errours?</hi> as <hi>we know but in part</hi> of the things of God,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.9.</note> ſo we know but in part of the things of our own hearts. Firſt convictions diſcover much, but not all; they leave much ſin undiſcover'd; and of the ſin that is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, there is much evil in it that is not. Hence that of <hi>Job,</hi> (chap. 13.23.) <hi>How many are mine iniquities and ſins? make me to know my tranſgreſſion and my ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a great miſtake to think the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing work of the ſpirit is over when once it hath diſcovered to a man his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful eſtate, and brought him to cloſe with Jeſus Chriſt, there is need of conviction in order to <hi>Sanctification,</hi> as well as in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to <hi>Converſion.</hi> There are <hi>ſinful frames</hi> of heart, as well as a <hi>ſinful eſtate;</hi> and though a Believer need the convictions of the Spirit, but <hi>once</hi> as to his <hi>ſinful
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:63179:184"/>
eſtate,</hi> yet he needs them <hi>always</hi> as to the <hi>carnal frames</hi> of the heart. Therefore he cryes out, <hi>that which I ſee not teach thou me.</hi> Job 34.32. As there is a height and depth in the <hi>love of Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 3.18, 19.</note> which paſſes knowledge, ſo there is alſo in the <hi>luſts of the heart.</hi> And as it is the light of the Spirit which ſhews us <hi>the unſearchable riches</hi> of the former; So he alſo diſcovers to us the <hi>unſeen filthineſs</hi> of the latter.</p>
               <p>And this is a great reaſon why many good men complain of ſin more after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion than they did before; and ſtill the more they grow into acquaintance with their own hearts, the more they complain of indwelling luſts. It is not becauſe their <hi>luſts</hi> increaſe, but becauſe their <hi>light</hi> increaſes. Not becauſe they <hi>ſin</hi> more, but becauſe they <hi>ſee</hi> more of ſin. As other Graces of the Spirit, ſo that of Light, is a growing thing; and the more the light of the Spirit is increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the more of the evil of ſin is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. But notwithſtanding their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of what they ſee, yet ſtill they deſire to ſee more. Though a Believer finds <hi>delight</hi> only in the fight of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; yet he finds a <hi>profit</hi> in the knowledge of his ſins. There are two things which teſtifie aloud to the goodneſs of our ſtate. One is when we deſire to <hi>feel</hi> more of the <hi>Grace of Chriſt;</hi> the other is, when we deſire to <hi>know</hi> more of the hidden <hi>luſts of our own hearts.</hi> The one makes us more
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:63179:184"/>
                  <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>thankful,</hi> the other makes us more <hi>vigilant</hi> and <hi>watchful.</hi> This is one thing the hypocrite fails in; he never ſearches to know his ſecret ſins: he prides himſelf in his ſeeming graces, but he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſearches to know his hidden corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He may boaſt with the <hi>Phariſee</hi> (Luke 18.) of his Faſting and Praying; but he can't truly pray with <hi>David, Search me, O God, and know my heart, try me, and ſee if there be any wicked way in me.</hi> Pſal. 132.23, 24.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This enmity in Believers againſt ſin appears in the confeſſion of ſin, whereby the Believer accuſes and charges himſelf before God. For this is a great blow to ſin. Confeſſion is an act of mortification. By our Law no man is bound to accuſe himſelf, but by the Law of God he is. <hi>He ſhall confeſs that he hath ſinned, and ſhall bring his Treſpaſs Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.</hi> Lev. 5.5, 6. The Offering for ſin is not enough without the confeſſion of ſin, <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge thine iniquity that thou haſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed againſt the Lord.</hi> Jer. 3.13. The <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians</hi> are againſt the Confeſſing of ſin in the Children of God; and we have others leaven'd with the ſame Spiritual Pride; they look upon it as a ſervile work, below the dignity of a Chriſtian State. But till a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever get above the committing of ſin, how can he be above the confeſſion of ſin? it is a duty as needful as the labour of the pump is to the leaking veſſel; what the Ship leaks in, the pump muſt caſt out.

And therefore this hath been the practiſe of good men in all times, not only of <hi>David,</hi>

               <p>In ſome caſes it is a duty to confeſs our ſins to man, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16. as in caſe of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſcandal to the Church. Or of private injury to our Neighbour. Or in caſe of Spiritual Troubles; that ſo we may have the advantage of good mens Prayers and Counſels. But it is in all caſes neceſſary to confeſs ſin to God.<note place="margin">Joſh. 7.19.</note> It is a great Glory done to him. It puts honour upon all his attributes. <hi>My ſon</hi> (ſaid <hi>Joſhua</hi> to <hi>Achan) give glory to the Lord, and make confeſſion to him.</hi> It is the way to ſtop the progreſs of ſin. While it is concealed it is out of the reach of thoſe means that ſhould give check to it.</p>
               <p>It is the moſt rational way to cure Soul troubles, and ſettle our comfort. Sin is like an impoſtume while it is gathering it is painful, but when it is broke or lanced, and runs, then there is eaſe. Or like a wind lockt up in the Earth, which cauſes great Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, till it finds a vent; and then the Earth is quiet.</p>
               <p>It commends the vertue of Chriſt's Blood, when we open to him thoſe mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal wounds which none but he can cure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="345" facs="tcp:63179:185"/>It puts an edge upon prayer; he that hath no ſin to acknowledge; hath but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle mercy to beg.</p>
               <p>It is the next way to forgiveneſs. <hi>If any ſay I have ſinned, and it profited me not, he will deliver his Soul from going into the pit.</hi> Job 33.27, 28. In the firſt Covenant it was, He that <hi>commits ſin</hi> ſhall dye. But in the ſecond Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, he that <hi>confeſſes ſin</hi> ſhall be forgiven. 1 Joh. 1.9.</p>
               <p>Confeſſion ſpeakes out ſuch a ſenſibleneſs of ſin, as works the Soul to a ready compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with any terms of deliverance. And a heart brought over to ſubmit to Gods reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, is in a fair way to a cure. Though ſin be a deſperate Diſeaſe, yet it is never deadly where the Patient is ready to uſe Gods Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines.</p>
               <p>This confeſſion leaves ſuch a dread of ſin upon the heart, that it dare not return to it as it was wont. I do not ſay but that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly a Believer may, through the prevalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of luſt and temptation, fall into the ſame ſin he hath confeſſed to God; yet it ſhall not prevail as formerly. But it is not every kind of Confeſſion that ſpeaks out an enmity to ſin. It is poſſible a man may often confeſs ſin, and yet ne-ver forſake it; but perſiſt in it all his days; and periſh in it at laſt. <hi>Saul</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, and yet periſhed. <hi>Judas</hi> confeſſed his ſin, and yet loſt his Soul. Therefore</p>
               <p>It muſt be free and voluntary, not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and extorted.</p>
               <p>It muſt be in ſincerity and uprightneſs of heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="346" facs="tcp:63179:186"/>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 38.18.</note>It muſt be with brokenneſs of heart. <hi>I will declare mine iniquity, I will be ſorry for my ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It muſt be with a hearty reſolution againſt ſin.</p>
               <p>This is another thing the Hypocrite comes ſhort in: he cannot thus confeſs ſin: <hi>he flatters himſelf in his own eyes, till his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity be found to be hateful.</hi> Pſal. 36.2. <hi>He covers his Tranſgreſſion as Adam, by hiding his iniquity in his boſom.</hi> Job. 31.33.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This odds in Believers againſt ſin appears in the hating of ſin. There is <hi>odium abominationis,</hi> and <hi>odium inimicitiae.</hi> One is a hatred that cauſes <hi>averſation:</hi> the other is a hatred that cauſes <hi>oppoſition.</hi> Both ways the Believer hates ſin.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) He turns from it as being a thing offenſive and loathſome to the Spiritual Appetite, and Renewed Will. No natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man can thus hate ſin, becauſe there is a ſutableneſs between the Heart and Luſt. He may poſſibly hate <hi>that which is ſin;</hi> but he cannot hate it <hi>as it is ſin;</hi> for then he would hate all ſin. One of a tenacious gripple humour may hate pride and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality. One that is prodigal and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe may hate Covetouſneſs. And yet he may not hate ſin <hi>formally</hi> conſidered; though he hates that which <hi>materially</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered is ſin. This kind of hatred of ſin is uſually for the ſake of ſome other ſin: it is only a reſerving the affections for ſome Luſt that ſuits him better. So that it
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:63179:186"/>
may be ſaid of Luſt in this caſe, as is ſaid of the Sea; what ground it loſes in one place, it gains in another. Whilſt he hates one ſin, he loves another; whilſt he turns from one, he cleaves to another. He cannot hate ſin <hi>as ſin;</hi> this is peculiar to Believers. There is no Hypocrite in the World that can unfeignedly hate eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſin: he cannot ſay with <hi>David,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſalm 119.128.</note> 
                  <hi>I hate every falſe way,</hi> but the Believer can, and doth: I don't ſay that he ceaſeth from all acts of ſin; that is impoſſible, ſo long as Grace is imperfect, and he carries <hi>a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of death</hi> about him: but he hates all ſin; and darling ſins above all, as being the worſt of ſins: for theſe are they where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God hath been moſt diſhonoured, the Mind moſt blinded, the Heart moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched, Satan moſt gratified, and the Soul moſt wounded.</p>
               <p>To diſlike ſome ſins and not others is not hatred. If the heart be right with God, the ſame reaſons that induce us to hate one ſin, will induce us to hate all. God hates all; and wherever the Divine Nature is wrought, it ſhews it ſelf in ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſpoſitions. It is a Univerſal Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which as it inclines the heart to all good, ſo it ſets it againſt all ſin. And it muſt needs be ſo, or elſe how can a man be ſaid to be in ſubjection to Jeſus Chriſt: for one ſin keeps poſſeſſion for Satan as well as a thouſand.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="348" facs="tcp:63179:187"/>And this diſcovers many that would prove their ſubjection to Chriſt by their hating ſin, when as they do not hate all ſin. There is ever ſome luſt in reſerve, of which they ſay as <hi>Jacob</hi> of his beloved <hi>Benjamin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 42.38.</note> 
                  <hi>He ſhall not go.</hi> Or as <hi>Naaman</hi> of his bowing to <hi>Rimmon, when I bow my ſelf in the houſe of Rimmon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Kings 5.18.</note> 
                  <hi>the Lord pardon thy ſervant in this thing.</hi> Now ſuppoſe a Woman ſhould love her Husband better than a thouſand, and a thouſand men; yet if there be any one that ſhe loves and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and deſires more than him, would ye not ſay ſhe was a harlot? yes, as really as ſhe that proſtitutes her ſelf to all that paſs by. He that indulges to any one ſin was never yet truly under the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt. Though a Believer may poſſibly fall into many ſins, yet there is no Believer but hates every ſin.</p>
               <p>And let me tell you, I know not a ſurer ſign of a mans being under the power of Grace than this. For what elſe is it that can make a man loath that ſin that he lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as himſelf? Many a man may be angry with ſin, but that is conſiſtent with love. Many a man may forbear ſin, for fear of ſhame or puniſhment. But this is not to hate ſin as ſin. When ſin is loathed as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a violation of Gods Law: a contempt of his Authority: contrary to his Nature; an Enemy to his Service and Honour: a grief to the Spirit: this is to hate ſin as ſin: and he that thus hates ſin, muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:63179:187"/>
hate all ſin: for all ſin violates his Law, is contrary to his nature, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes his Service, and grieves his Spirit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as he hates it with a hatred of abomination; ſo he hates it with a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of enmity: and this appears in a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous activity againſt ſin.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He prays againſt it. <hi>Order my ſteps in thy word, and let not any iniquity have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over me.</hi> Pſal. 119.133. Prayers and Tears are the Chriſtians Weapons; not only againſt the <hi>malice</hi> of enemies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, but alſo againſt the <hi>miſchief</hi> of ſin within. He don't pray againſt his ſin, as it is ſaid <hi>Auſtin</hi> did in his Natural State, who was afraid that God ſhould grant his requeſt. He prayed one thing, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red another. But he prays as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>waſh me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanſe me from my ſin.</hi> Pſal. 51.2. Oh the ſighs and groans that a gracious heart ſends up to God, under the load and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of ſin. <hi>We groan being burdened.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.4.</note> Hence that of the Apoſtle, Rom. 7.24. <hi>O wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death!</hi> never did poor Priſoner more long and wiſh to be freed from his chains, then the Believer doth to be rid of his ſins. None can know what the wreſtlings of a gracious heart are with God againſt Corruption, but they that have been wearied with the burden of it.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:63179:188"/>2. He mourns and ſorrows under it as the daily burden of his Soul. Grace ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the heart, and then ſin makes it mourn. <hi>They ſhall be on the mountains like Doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity,</hi> Ezek. 7.16. And this is ſorrow of the right kind There is a great deal of ſorrow cauſed by ſin that is not right; therefore the Apoſtle ſpeaks of being made ſorry after a Godly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. <hi>I rejoyced not that ye were made ſorry, but that ye ſorrowed to Repentance, for ye were made ſorry after a Godly manner.</hi> 2. Cor. 7.9. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ye ſorrowed according to God. And it is known from all other ſorrow.</p>
               <p>By its object, and that is ſin. Sin more than any thing: and ſpecial ſin more than any ſin.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sin more than any thing; more than ſuffering, more than affliction, more than Hell. Nothing in the world cauſes that ſorrow in a gracious heart as ſin doth. <hi>Father, I have ſinned againſt Heaven, and in thy ſight,</hi> ſayes the poor prodigal, Luk. 15.21. he doth not ſay, I am full of wants, ready to famiſh for bread, but here is his wound, <hi>father I have ſinned.</hi> So as it was with <hi>David.</hi> 2 Sam. 24.10. <hi>I have ſinned greatly in that I have done, and now I beſeech thee take away the iniquity of thy ſervant;</hi> He doth not ſay take away this judgment, this peſtilence: nay, he is willing to bear it, ver. 17. <hi>Lo, I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:63179:188"/>
and done wickedly, but thoſe Sheep what have they done? Let thine hand be againſt me.</hi> He is willing to indure the ſmart, ſo as God would remove the guilt. He would quietly bear his hand in chaſtiſement for ſin, ſo that his heart were but towards him in the pardon of ſin. It is not ſmart but guilt that is the chief cauſe of ſorrow in a gracious heart.</p>
               <p>Now the hypocrite cryes out more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſmart then guilt. Puniſhment cauſes ſorrow, when ſin doth not. <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> is under a plague of <hi>Frogs;</hi> and he preſently calls for <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron:</hi> and what muſt they do? <hi>Intreat the Lord that he may take away the frogs from me.</hi> Exod. 8.8. he doth not ſay, that he may take away my ſin from me: he was very ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the <hi>plague of frogs,</hi> but had no ſenſe of the <hi>plague of his heart.</hi> So that here you ſee the difference between <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh: David</hi> is for the taking away of ſin rather then of judgment: <hi>Pharaoh</hi> is for the taking away of judgment, but not a word of the taking away of ſin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. True ſorrow for ſin is more for ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſins then for any other ſin. Though all ſin is matter of ſorrow, yet ſpecial ſins above all: And it muſt needs be ſo, for by theſe God hath been moſt diſhonoured. By theſe he hath ſo often broke with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. By theſe he hath given the deepeſt wounds to his own Conſcience. By theſe Satan hath ſo long maintained his
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:63179:189"/>
power and rule in the Soul. And ſo eaſily inſnared and overcome him.</p>
               <p>The hypocrite never ſorrows for his ſpecial ſins. His ſorrow as it is feigned, ſo it is either for ſome petty ſins, or ſuch as are common to him with others. But he feels no remorſe for his boſom luſts: nor comes near to that which is the chief cauſe of controverſie between God and his Soul. His beloved luſt lies ſecure in his heart, without the leaſt diſturbance or notice taken of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He maintains a conſtant conflict againſt ſin. And this is a natural effect of hatred; for <hi>hatred ſtirreth up ſtrife,</hi> Prov. 10.12. hence ye read of <hi>ſtriving against ſin.</hi> Heb. 12.4. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> it is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary word, and implies an oppoſing and fighting as againſt an enemy, to whom a man is reſolved not to yield. And the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is here ſaid to be <hi>ſin;</hi> which is the greateſt enemy in the world; and makes the fierceſt war: for it <hi>wars againſt the Soul.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.11. againſt the grace of the Soul: againſt the peace and comfort of the ſoul: againſt the life and ſalvation of the Soul. Hence it is that the life of a Chriſtian is a continual warfare. The Age that men obſerve in Civil Wars is from ſixteen years old to ſixty: but this war commences from the firſt moment of taking up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt, to the laſt moment that a man lives in the world. Every man that is born again, is born <hi>a

                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>
                  </note> in the preſent Tenſe, and ſo it notes two things.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That ſo ſoon as ever Grace is wrought in the heart, it ſhews it ſelf in ſtrifes and conteſts with luſt and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>it luſteth againſt the Fleſh,</hi> or elſe it is not Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this conteſt once begun will never end, ſo long as any one luſt remains in the heart. Nor can it, for this hatred of ſin wrought by grace in the heart is ſo radicated in the new nature, and ſo eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to it, that as grace is increaſed, ſo this hatred is heightened; and needs it muſt, for all hatred ſprings from love; <hi>amor odii cauſa,</hi> it is love to God and Chriſt which works to hatred of ſin; and therefore as love grows ſtronger, ſo our hatred of ſin ſtill grows greater; ſo that this conteſt can never end, but in the death and deſtruction of every luſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="354" facs="tcp:63179:190"/>Other enemies a Chriſtian can love, and pity, and forgive and pray for; but he hath no pity for ſin. It is a hatred wrought by the Spirit of God, which is full of indignation and revenge. <hi>What in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation it wrought in you, yea what revenge.</hi> 2 Cor. 7.11. Hence it is that he is ſo converſant and conſtant in the uſe of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances: his great end is to ſubdue and weaken luſt under all.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He uſes the word to this end, for this is <hi>the ſword of the Spirit,</hi> Eph. 6.17. and in conflicts either with corruption within, or with Temptation without, there is none to that. No man was ever overcome either by Corruption or Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſo long as he kept cloſe to the word. <hi>I write to you young men, becauſe ye are ſtrong, and have overcome the wicked one.</hi> 1 Epiſt. John 2.13. Here is an evidence of their ſtrength, their overcoming the wicked one. But where lies their ſtrength? that is intimated, ver. 14. <hi>I write to you young men, becauſe ye are ſtrong, and the word of God abides in you, and ye have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the wicked one.</hi> The abiding of the word in the heart implies the power and virtue of the word taking hold of the heart; and there it is <hi>mighty through God to the pulling down of ſtrong holds.</hi> 2 Cor. 10.4. The abiding of the word in the heart includes every part of the word, precepts, promiſes and threatenings; and the Believer makes uſe of all to ſubdue luſt.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:63179:190"/>1. The Precepts of the word, where all ſin is forbidden. Hath God forbid ſin, and ſhall I indulge to it? ought not his word to be my rule? can I be true to God, and tranſgreſs his Precepts? what is ſin but <hi>a tranſgreſſion of the law?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.4.</note> and ſhall I dare to invade the rights of God, and deny his Sovereignty? Thus his <hi>heart ſtands in awe of the word.</hi> Pſal. 119.161.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The promiſes of the word, he makes uſe of them to incourage hope; and <hi>hope purifies the heart.</hi> 1 Epiſt. John 3.3. Hath God made ſuch promiſes, ſo many, ſo great, of this life, of that to come, and all to incourage the Soul to dye to ſin, and ſhall I live in it, and ſo fruſtrate my hope in the promiſe? Hath God ſo often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Heaven and Glory to ſuch as morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie ſin, and ſhall I live to the Fleſh, and dye? Thus <hi>having theſe promiſes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 7, 1.</note> he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to be <hi>cleanſed from all filthineſs, both of Fleſh and Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. He makes uſe of the threatenings of the word as an incentive to fear, for <hi>by the fear of the Lord men depart from evil.</hi> Prov. 16.6. Thus <hi>the law of his God is in his heart, ſo that none of his ſteps ſhall ſlide,</hi> Pſal. 37.31.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He uſes the Sacraments for this end, both Baptiſm and the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His Baptiſm, he reflects upon it as a token and ſeal of that Covenant, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God hath made himſelf over to him to

be his God: and in which God requires a forſaking of all ſin; and by his owning this Covenant he hath taken God for his God, and devoted himſelf to live to his will; and therefore looks upon himſelf as ſtrictly ingaged againſt every luſt; and for this cauſe labours daily to <hi>put off the body of the ſins of the Fleſh.</hi> Col. 2.11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lords Supper, here by Faith he ſees Chriſt Crucified for ſin; and how can this but make him hate ſin, and height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en his rage and indignation againſt it; ſhall Chriſt dye for my ſins, and ſhall I ſuffer any luſt to live, that had a hand in his death? Beſides this Supper is a ſolemn renewing of Covenant with God; and no man can renew Covenant with God, but he muſt ſolemnly ingage to hate and renounce all the luſts of the Fleſh. Thus the Chriſtian uſes and improves every Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance to carry on the conteſt againſt ſin, that ſo he may mortifie, and deſtroy it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. His hatred of ſin appears in his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes and reſolutions againſt it; The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with Hell and Death is now broken, and he reſolves never to ſay a confederacy to the luſts of the fleſh any more. When he is at any time ſurprized by ſin, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he is, he hates it the more; and it cauſes him to iſſue out a practical decree for God, like that of <hi>David, I ſaid I will take heed to my ways that I ſin not.</hi> Pſal. 39.1. When once a man hath truly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:63179:191"/>
up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt, the reſolve and bent of his Will is never to ſin more. Though a Believer cannot promiſe abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely not to ſin, yet he may fully pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe not to ſin; So did <hi>David, I am pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, my mouth ſhall not tranſgreſs.</hi> Pſal. 17.3. No man can be ſaid to hate ſin that doth not purpoſe againſt it; and he that doth not hate ſin, his heart is not right with God.</p>
               <p>And this is one of thoſe fruits of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt, whereby judgment may be made <hi>a poſteriori.</hi> Now I would to God that young ones would try themſelves by this Character. What is the diſpoſition of your heart towards ſin? do ye make it your work to ſearch out ſin? do ye labour to know more of your ſecret luſts, and carnal frames, and deceitful hearts? this every one that is under Chriſts <hi>Yoke</hi> doth?</p>
               <p>Do ye accuſe and charge your ſelves home before God for ſin? and is it done freely, and in ſincerity, and brokenneſs of heart? this every one that is under Chriſts <hi>Yoke</hi> doth.</p>
               <p>Do ye hate ſin with a hatred of <hi>abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> I ſo as to loath and turn from ſin? and is it from all ſin? and do ye hate it with a hatred of <hi>enmity?</hi> do ye pray againſt it? do ye mourn under it? do ye keep up the ſpiritual conflict, ſtriving againſt ſin? and uſing means of Grace, and Ordinances to keep down ſin? this
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:63179:192"/>
every one that is under Chriſts <hi>Yoke</hi> doth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Is the bent and reſolution of your ſoul againſt ſin? have you taken up fixed pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes never to live to the luſts of the fleſh more? thus every one that is under the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt doth. By this then every one may make a judgment whether ever he hath taken up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt, or not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It may be known by living to God in a courſe of Holy Obedience. Whoever hath truly put on the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt makes it his work and buſineſs to live to Chriſt; there is ſuch a Principle of grace infuſed, that obedience becomes natural. And this obedience is an infallible ſign of your ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore a fit medium to try your State by. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. What better Teſtimony can there be of our ſubjection to Chriſt than that which evidences the work of holineſs in the heart? Now obedience in the life is a ſure evidence of the work of holineſs within. It is the natural fruit of the feed of God ſowed in the good ground of an honeſt heart. Holineſs is an inward frame, obedience is an overt act proceeding from it. Holineſs is the Divine Nature plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in us; Obedience is the fruit that grows upon that Root. Holineſs is our Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the <hi>nature</hi> of God; Obedience is our Conformity to the will of God. And nothing can prove our participation of the <hi>divine nature,</hi> like our ſubjection to
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:63179:192"/>
the <hi>Divine Will.</hi> Holineſs is the being of the Spiritual Life in us; Obedience is the operation of that Life according to the degrees of it in the Soul. For there is a great difference in the degrees of Spiritual Life in Believers; it is variouſly Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated; to one more, to another leſs. All Believers have it, but ſome have it <hi>more abundantly,</hi> Joh. 10.10. and according to the meaſure of the life of holineſs in us, ſuch is our ſtrength to obey: and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſtrength of our obedience, ſuch will the evidence of our ſubjection to Chriſt, and his <hi>Yoke</hi> be.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What greater evidence can there be of our ſubjection to Chriſt, then that which is the proper and eſſential act of the new creature? and that obedience is. It is not more eſſential to the eye to ſee, nor to the ear to hear, then it is for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed heart to obey God. A Believer doth but act his nature in obeying: and that appears from that pleaſure and delight which (ſo far as renewed) he takes in it. Acts of nature are acts of delight; hence that of the Apoſtle Rom. 7.22. <hi>I delight in the law of God after the inner man.</hi> And that of <hi>David, I delight to do thy will O my God.</hi> And whence this delight ariſes the next words tell you. <hi>Thy Law is within my heart.</hi> Pſal. 40.8. The principle of grace within makes obedience to the law of God a delight, and delight in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the law of God proves the truth
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:63179:193"/>
of that Principle within. All delight in doing ariſes from a ſuitableneſs between the Principle and the Precept; the heart and the work. If there are precepts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned us, and a defect of Principles in us, much may be done, but there can be no delight in doing: the commands will be grievous.</p>
               <p>But it is not every kind of Obedience that can prove the truth of our ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Chriſt. A hypocrite may go far in the outward part of obedience; he may have <hi>a form of Godlineſs:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.5.</note> and what is that? but a reſemblance of a Chriſtian in all the outward lineaments of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. He may be able to do all external acts of obedience in common with Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; But there are ſome things eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to Believers as ſuch, the goodneſs whereof doth adhere intrinſecally to this work done: as to <hi>love</hi> God, to <hi>fear</hi> God, to <hi>truſt</hi> in God, to <hi>delight</hi> in God. Theſe mingled with our outward duties make them to be obedience of the right kind; and theſe no hypocrite can attain to, and therefore cannot perform any one act of true obedience. For obedience conſiſts in a full conformity to the will of God as revealed in his word from a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of holineſs within.</p>
               <p>Many profeſs ſubjection to Chriſt in word, but deny it in works; calling him <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> but not doing the things which he ſayes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.46. And many have
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:63179:193"/>
flexible knees, but ſtiff necks: bowing the former to the name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> but will not bow the latter to the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Jeſus; <hi>being abominable, diſobedient, and to every good work reprobate.</hi> Tit. 1.16. There is no ſuch Teſtimony of your being under the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt, as conformity to the will of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>By this then you may make a judgment in this matter. When the ſpies return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from ſearching the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> they brought with them a <hi>cluſter of Grapes, and Pomegranates, and Figs;</hi> Numbers 13.23. and when they came to give an account of their ſearch, they ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them the fruit of the Land; and ſaid, <hi>ſurely it flowes with milk and hony, and this is the fruit of it.</hi> ver. 27. q. d. the Land that yields ſuch good fruit muſt needs be a good Land. The fruit of being under Chriſts <hi>yoke,</hi> is dying to ſin, and living to God in a Holy Obedience. And by theſe two Characters your State may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be known. The heart that yields ſuch fruit is ſurely a good heart. Pray obſerve that of the Apoſtle, Rom. 6.16. <hi>Know ye not that to whom ye yield your ſelves ſervants to obey, his ſervants ye are whom ye obey; whether of ſin unto death, or of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto righteouſneſs?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not being Baptized into the name of Chriſt, nor taking up the outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſt and Religion, that can
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:63179:194"/>
diſtinguiſh between the ſervants of Chriſt and Satan. Here is a ſurer rule; He that <hi>obeys ſin is the ſervant of ſin;</hi> and he that <hi>obeys Chriſt is the ſervant of Chriſt.</hi>

               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">Duty</note>1. The firſt is thankfulneſs. Though this contributes nothing to God, yet it is that which he is delighted with. It ſhews the
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:63179:194"/>
honeſty and integrity of the heart in aſcribing effects to their proper cauſes. Thankfulneſs diminiſhes the creature to himſelf, and magnifies God. It ſhews a man looks upon himſelf as nothing, and God as all. Therefore bleſs God and be thankful for this great mercy. Is there not a cauſe? For</p>
               <p n="1">1. How came you to take up Chriſts <hi>yoke?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 6.17. Iſa. 26.13.</note> Time was when <hi>ye were the ſervants of ſin, other Lords had dominion</hi> over you. Time was when you were ſlaves to luſt; How came you to take up the <hi>yoke</hi> of Chriſt? It was not natural; for by nature we are enemies to grace and holineſs. It was the fruit of the wiſdom of God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed upon the Soul; it was he that gave thee counſel to make this choice; and therefore bleſs him. So <hi>David</hi> ſayes in the like caſe, <hi>I will bleſs the Lord who hath given me counſel.</hi> Pſa. 16.7. Counſel for what? to take the Lord for his Lord; and that implies taking up his <hi>yoke. O my ſoul thou haſt ſaid to the Lord, thou art my Lord,</hi> ver. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>thou art my Lord;</hi> that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies ſubjection; <hi>Thou haſt ſaid thou art my Lord,</hi> that implyes a Covenant reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. So that here he chooſes God for his portion and chief good, and for his higheſt Lord; and how he came to make this choice he tells you, ver. 7. It was the Lord that counſelled him to this; and therefore he reſolves the praiſe and glory ſhall be to him; <hi>I will bleſs the Lord who
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:63179:195"/>
hath given me counſel.</hi> Go you and do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: bleſs the Lord who hath perſwaded and over power'd your hearts to cloſe with Chriſt. <hi>For no man comes to Chriſt except the Father draw him.</hi> Joh. 6.44.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is the wiſeſt choice that ever you made to chooſe Chriſt for your Lord, and to put your ſelves under his <hi>yoke.</hi> It may be you think you choſe wiſely in other matters. In your yoke fellow, in your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, in your dwelling, &amp;c. but you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhewed ſuch wiſdom as in this. When <hi>Job</hi> asks, (Chap. 28.12.) <hi>where ſhall wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom be found, and where is the place of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 28.14.15.21.</note> and having told you where it is not, not in Silver and Gold; not in Voyages to Sea; Not to be purchaſed with all Riches; nor found in the land of the living; He tells you none know what, nor where true wiſdom is, but God, ver. 23. <hi>God underſtands the way thereof, and he knowes the place thereof: and it is he that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects us to it.</hi> ver. 28. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto man he ſaid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the fear of the Lord that is wiſdom, and to depart from evil is underſtanding.</hi> There is no man truly wiſe but he that fears God and keeps his Commandments.<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12.13.</note> See where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the wiſdom of this taking up Chriſts <hi>yoke</hi> is manifeſt in ſix particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is manifeſt in this, that the beſt and wiſeſt of men in all Ages have done it: they have rather choſen Obedience to Chriſt in the meaneſt ſervices, then to be found in complyance with luſt. What
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:63179:195"/>
did <hi>David</hi> mean when he ſaid, <hi>I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be a door keeper in the houſe of my God, then to dwell in the Tents of wickedneſs?</hi> Pſal. 84.10. It was a wiſe preferring the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſervice of Chriſt, before the greateſt pleaſures that wicked men enjoy. And what meant <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>refuſe to be called the ſon of Pharaohs Daughter,</hi> and <hi>to chooſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon, eſteeming the reproaches of Chriſt greater rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es than the treaſures of Egypt?</hi> Heb. 11.24, 25, 26.</p>
               <p>What was the meaning of this, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſhew that he preferred the worſt of Chriſts <hi>Yoke</hi> before the beſt of ſin? And what made the Apoſtles forſake all and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.19.</note> but to ſhew that <hi>wiſdom is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified of her children;</hi> and that they were ready to ſacrifice all for the ſervice of ſuch a Maſter? And what made thoſe primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Martyrs (Heb. 11.) ſuffer ſuch <hi>mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſcourgings, bonds, impriſonments, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> &amp;c. but their faithfulneſs to Chriſt and his ways? And if the beſt in all Ages have taken up Chriſts <hi>yoke,</hi> then this makes the wiſdom of this practiſe manifeſt: Great reaſon therefore you ſhould bleſs God for, and give him the glory of <hi>your profeſſed ſubjection to Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The wiſdom of taking up this <hi>yoke</hi> of Chriſt is evident in that it is ſuch a <hi>yoke,</hi> all the duties whereof commend themſelves to every mans choice. It was
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:63179:196"/>
not ſo in the Precepts of the Old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; a great part of thoſe Laws had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in them to commend them to a mans choice, (ſo long as their ſymbolical na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was not underſtood) ſave what the authority of God in commanding their obſervation gave to them. Circumciſion, legal waſhings, ſacrifices, &amp;c. were but <hi>beggarly Elements</hi> when the command of God for their obſervation was taken off;<note place="margin">Gal. 4.9.</note> therefore the Apoſtle calls them <hi>a yoke of bondage,</hi> Gal. 5.1. Which ſhews that their obſervation of them was more becauſe God commanded them, than out of any intrinſecal goodneſs which was in them. They obeyed them, not out of love of the thing commanded, but out of love to that God who commanded them. But now the precepts of the Goſpel, and the things commanded there are deſireable for themſelves. If they had not been injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to love God, to fear him, to worſhip him in Spirit, to be righteous, godly, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, chaſt, temperate; to be meek, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and contented, &amp;c. theſe are <hi>amabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia pro ſe,</hi> lovely in themſelves, and tend to the peace and ſatisfaction of the mind; beſides their relation to a future happineſs. And there is no man that acts up to the dictates of a conſidering mind but would chooſe theſe things, though you ſhould ſuppoſe him under no expreſs command thereunto.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="367" facs="tcp:63179:196"/>3. The wiſdom of taking up Chriſts <hi>yoke</hi> appears in this, that whatever your work is, your help is greater than your work, and your ſuccour greater than your ſervice. That which makes any duty diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and burdenſome is, when it maſters our abilities for performance. Now this can't be ſaid of any work Chriſt calls us to; For as thy work is ſo ſhall thy ſtrength be. If God calls out one St. to greater ſervices than another, he will furniſh him with more ſtrength and help than another. <hi>I laboured more abundantly then they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. His work was great, and his help was great. He abounded in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and God abounded in grace. He did more than all, and he recieved more than all. And if you would know what helps Chriſtians have in the way of obedience; They are theſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They have the help of the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Chriſt; and it is a great power and ſtrength that is derived from them to the ſoul that ſits daily under them.<note place="margin">Pro. 10.29</note> 
                  <hi>The way of the Lord is ſtrength to the upright.</hi> The Ordinances of Chriſt are not empty things: though they have no fulneſs of their own, yet they give out much from the Fountain; <hi>They go from ſtrength to ſtrength,</hi> How ſo? <hi>Every one of them in Sion appears before God.</hi> Pſal. 84.7.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They have the help of the prayers of all the Saints. For as the prayers of
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:63179:197"/>
every Believer are directed to the good of all the Church of Chriſt; So the prayers of the whole are deſigned for the good of every member. There is a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual traffick in Heaven by the prayers of Saints one for another; if one Believer be in temptations, in darkneſs, in ſufferings and troubles, All the Saints of God are wreſtling for his relief. So the Church did for <hi>Peter</hi> when in priſon, and their prayers did more to releaſe him, then all jaylers and fetters could do to detain him. Mark that of the Apoſtle 2 Cor. 1.10, 11. <hi>Who delivered us from ſo great a death; and doth deliver, in whom we truſt he will yet deliver us; you alſo helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift beſtowed upon us by the means of many perſons, thanks may be given by many on our behalf.</hi> The prayers of the Saints are greatly available one for another. We have many a mercy that we never prayed particularly for, but poſſibly it hath been the fruit of others prayers; and therefore the Apoſtle calls it <hi>a gift beſtowed upon us by the means of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſons.</hi> Others ſow the ſeed, and we enter into their harveſt, and reap their labours. And this is one great part of that Communion of Saints which in our Creed we ſay that we believe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They have a help greater than all this, and that is the help of Jeſus Chriſt: and he is the <hi>mighty helper.</hi> That is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Scripture, could we believe it, and
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:63179:197"/>
live upon it, Zech. 10.12. <hi>I will ſtrengthen them in the Lord, and they ſhall walk up and down in his name.</hi> What, or who can be too hard for ſuch as walk in the ways and worſhip of Chriſt with the ſtrength of Chriſt? Now the Lord Chriſt helps two ways.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) By his powerful interceſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he is ever praying and pleading for you, Heb. 7.25.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) By his Almighty Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for how are your ſins mortified but by the Spirit? Rom. 8.13. And how are your hearts quickened in duty, but by the Spirit?<note place="margin">Joh. 6.63.</note> And how are you guided in the ways of God, but by the Spirit. Joh. 16.13. And how are you taught? but by the Spirit. 1 Joh. 2.27. And who upholds you in your courſe? but the Spirit. Pſal. 51.12. Beſides the grace the Spirit works in you at firſt, you have ſpiritual incomes and <hi>ſupplies of the Spirit</hi> daily. Phil. 1.19.</p>
               <p>And is not the Believers help then great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than his work? now it was not ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law; there was great ſervice but little aſſiſtance: but now the Chriſtians help is greater then his work,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.13.</note> for <hi>it is God that works in you to will and to do.</hi> The works of Goſpel Obedience are more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, more ſpiritual, and therefore more difficult than any of the works of the Law; but ſo far as we have Communion with the power and ſtrength of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to actuate and inable us, they are all
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:63179:198"/>
eaſy and pleaſant. Goſpel duties may be difficult in reſpect of <hi>divine impoſition,</hi> but they are eaſy in regard of <hi>divine cooperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> The Father ſets the Child a Copy, and bids it write, the Child knows not how, but yet takes the Pen, and then the Father guides the hand, and the Child writes after the Copy. <hi>Lord,</hi> ſayes <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin, give what thou commandeſt, and then command what thou wilt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The wiſdom of taking up Chriſts <hi>yoke</hi> appears in this, that under this <hi>yoke,</hi> though the weakneſs of your obedience is great, yet the truth of your obedience is accepted. God looks at <hi>truth in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts,</hi> Pſal. 51.6. O the many weakneſſes that God paſſes by in his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, where he finds the heart and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on true to him; though there be much commanded, yet the leaſt you do is accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

But there is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs with thee that thou mayeſt be feared.</hi> Pſal. 130.3, 4. God will not take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of your fallings and infirmities. <hi>I will ſpare them as a man ſpares his ſon that ſerves him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mal. 3.17.</note> O what a ſweetneſs muſt this put into ſervice! how eaſie muſt it needs make the <hi>yoke</hi> of Chriſt, when the leaſt we do is accepted; as a handful of goats hair was for the Temple when it came from a willing heart. What reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have we to bleſs the Lord that ever
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:63179:198"/>
inclined our hearts to ſtoop to the <hi>yoke</hi> of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The wiſdom of taking up Chriſts <hi>yoke</hi> is evident in this, that herein true liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conſiſts. This may ſeem a Paradox; for ſinners do therefore indulge themſelves in their luſts becauſe there is liberty: and they therefore refuſe Chriſts <hi>yoke</hi> becauſe it abridges their liberty; they cannot live as they liſt. Now you muſt know there is a twofold liberty.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A carnal liberty; wherein a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt baſe heart takes a latitude to it ſelf, to live and act according to its own viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inclinations, without any reſtraint or controul. Indeed the <hi>yoke</hi> of Chriſt is an enemy to this liberty; and it were not worth the taking up if it ſhould not, for this liberty is only the licentiouſneſs of luſt, and no man ſuch a ſlave as he that is thus at liberty. He is <hi>a ſervant to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.19. Under the devils rule, <hi>led captive by him at his will,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.26. He is held in the chains of Hell, and will you call this liberty? are not the Saints at liberty in Heaven? and yet there is none of this liberty there? will ye call this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, to be loaded with the guilt of ſin? to be bound over to damnation? to be vexed daily with an accuſing Conſcience? to have all the threats of the word lye againſt thee? to have wrath hanging over thy head every moment? and God ready to throw thee into Hell? is this liberty
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:63179:199"/>
when thou art in ſuch a dreadful caſe, that thou dareſt not think of dying for fear of hell and damnation? better be the veryeſt gally ſlave in the world then thus at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But then</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a Spiritual liberty, which is wrought out for us by Chriſt; the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of his blood: John 8.36. <hi>If the ſon make you free then are ye free indeed.</hi> And he that partakes of this liberty may well be ſaid to be free indeed, for he is freed from the curſe of the Law. Gal. 3.10. He is freed from the condemning power of ſin. Rom. 8.1. He is freed from the Spirit of Bondage. Rom. 8.15. And he is freed from the dominion of ſin. Rom. 6.14. And a man never enjoyes this liberty till he comes under the <hi>yoke</hi> of Chriſt; and is there not reaſon to bleſs God for draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heart to Chriſt?</p>
               <p n="6">6. The wiſdom of taking up Chriſts <hi>yoke</hi> appears in this, that the longer you are under it, the eaſier you will find it. I will make it out in three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The longer you wear it, the lighter it will be: it is not ſo in other matters. A little burden in tract of time is heavy, and the longer it lyes the heavyer it is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of a waſt of ſtrength by long bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but Chriſts burden the longer it is born the lighter it is, becauſe though the burden is not diminiſhed, yet your ſtrength is increaſed.<note place="margin">Pſal. 84.7. Job 17.9.</note> 
                  <hi>They go from ſtrength to ſtrength. He that hath clean hands ſhall grow ſtronger
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:63179:199"/>
and ſtronger.</hi> And as ſpiritual ſtrength in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes, ſo ſpiritual difficulties muſt needs abate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The more progreſs you make in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, the greater teſtimony you ſhall have from conſcience of the uprightneſs of your hearts with God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and you can't ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine (unleſs you ever felt it) what peace this brings in, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. Nothing gives conſcience that advantage to witneſs aloud to our caſe, as godly ſincerity in our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Much obedience brings in much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. The more ſeed the more ſheaves; that Chriſtian is likeſt to injoy moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that walks moſt cloſe with God in the way of obedience. He hath comfort in the moſt difficult duties, even in his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for Chriſt; and they are the moſt pinching part of his <hi>Yoke.</hi> And yet <hi>as the ſufferings of Chriſt abound in us, ſo our conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation alſo aboundeth by Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5. And therefore Chriſt bids us rejoyce even in perſecution, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.11, 12.</p>
               <p>He hath comfort in the worſt of times, <hi>To the upright there ariſeth light in darkneſs, Pſal.</hi> 112.4. <hi>When the figtree doth not bloſſom,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hab. 3.18.</note> yet then he can <hi>joy in the God of his ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. Look to the <hi>Principles</hi> of your obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. No man can do the duties injoyn'd by Chriſt without a principle of life from Chriſt. <hi>Without me ye can do nothing,</hi> Joh. 15.5.
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:63179:200"/>
All performances which flow not from ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual principles wrought by Chriſt in the heart, ſtand for nothing in the account of God. Though much may be done, yet it is no obedience. Therefore when the Lord deſigns himſelf honour from the ſervice and obedience of any, he firſt makes them <hi>veſſels to honour meet for the maſters uſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.21.</note> 
                  <hi>and prepared to every good work;</hi> and how? but by infuſing ſpiritual principles into the ſoul where there were none before. As the Prophet, when he would heal the waters,<note place="margin">2 King 2.21, 22.</note> threw ſalt into the ſpring. Regeneration doth not lie in a change of actions, but in a change of principles. This is that <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Law in the heart,</hi> which God in the New Covenant promiſeth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. The writing the law with ink makes it a <hi>rule</hi> of obedience; but when it is written in the heart, it then becomes a <hi>principle</hi> of obedience. Chriſt calls it a making the tree good; <hi>firſt make the tree good, and the fruit will be good, Matth.</hi> 12.33. And it is elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where called <hi>a new heart and a new ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Ezek.</hi> 36.26. We muſt not by this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand any ſubſtantial newneſs. A ſinner in converſion is the ſame perſon that he was before, tho he is a new creature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſoul under a work of grace is the ſame in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance as before, and the faculties are the ſame. The change is not of the faculties, but of the qualities. As when a garment is cut into a new faſhion, the cloth is ſtill the ſame. <hi>Naaman</hi> was the ſame man when
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:63179:201"/>
he was a <hi>Leper,</hi> as when he was cured.</p>
               <p>The work of grace begins where ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan; the depravation of our nature was firſt in the mind and heart, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.18. in a corruption of principles. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly the work of renovation lies in fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the ſoul with contrary principles: and therefore God ſayes, <hi>I will put my law in their mind, and write it in their heart.</hi> That which is intended by it is, a planting in the ſoul thoſe principles of obedience whereby it is inabled to conform to the whole will of God. And this is the great thing that we ſhould look to in the whole courſe of our obedience, what the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are by which we are acted in duty; it being a matter of great concernment, for</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such as our principles are ſuch will our actions be. If our principles are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, our performances will be carnal; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound principles will produce unſound obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Actions can riſe no higher then the principles from whence they flow; the fruit can be no better than the tree that bears it. Our beſt actions come under the denomination of evil, if the principle they proceed from be not good; and ſo that which we account to be duty, God may reckon to be ſin. An action, in it ſelf indifferent, yet becomes holy, if the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple from whence it flows be holy. <hi>Quod forma eſt in phyſicis idem eſt principium in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralibus.</hi> Therefore it concerns us to look to our principles.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="377" facs="tcp:63179:201"/>2. The truth of any mans grace cannot be judged of by what he doth, but by the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples from which he doth what he doth. Gifts may for a time act as ſtrongly, &amp; carry a man out as zealouſly as grace: There was no diſcrimination in appearance between the corn of the ſtony ground and that which grew on the good ground, no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the likeneſs, as grew the one ſo grew the other; the ſame blade, and the ſame greenneſs; the difference lay in that which could not be ſeen, and that was in the root. The one had root the other had not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We can never come to a knowledge of the ſoundneſs or unſoundneſs, the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity or hypocriſie of our own hearts but by our principles. Hypocriſie may make as great a change of external actions as grace, but it can never make a change of principles;<note place="margin">Mat. 2.27.</note> it may <hi>clean the outſide of the cup and platter,</hi> but not the inſide. It may garniſh a ſepulchre of rotten bones, but cannot make the dead live within.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Such as a mans principles are ſuch will the arguments that move him to duty be. You may know much both of the truth and growth of grace by the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that move you to duty. Two may perform the ſame act of obedience, but the argument that draws them may be very different. One may be moved by the goodneſs of God,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 3.5.</note> 
                  <hi>They ſhall fear the Lord and his goodneſs;</hi> another by his juſtice and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:63179:202"/>
One may obey him as an indulgent father; another as a righteous judge. Fears of wrath and terrours of conſcience may compel one, while another is under the conſtraints of love, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. <hi>The love of Chriſt conſtrains us.</hi> One may obey out of reſpect to the command, another out of reſpect to himſelf. An inſtance of this you have in <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Shechem. Abraham</hi> is circumciſed in obedience to the command,<note place="margin">Gen. 17.23, 24.</note> but <hi>Shechem</hi> ſubmits to it for carnal advantage: <hi>The young man deferred not to do the thing becauſe he had delight in Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs daughter, Gen.</hi> 34.19.</p>
               <p>Our principles are then carnal, when the arguments of our obedience are ſo; The Devil himſelf, as bad as he is, yet he will ſometimes preſs a man to duty: he loves to ſail with the wind; he knows he hath the ſinner thereby in a ſnare, and God ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors him ſo much the more. He that doth a good work upon a bad argument provokes God, becauſe he doth that for the ſake of a luſt, that he would not do at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt. There is no ſuch friend to hold a man up in right evangelical obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience as right principles.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This is the great thing God looks at in all our obedience: not only what our works are, but what our principles are. And in the day of judgement God will not call us to account only for the actions we do, but for the principles we do them by; and we ſhall ſtand or fall according as they
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:63179:202"/>
are ſound or corrupt. The Apoſtle hints this to us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. in telling us that at the day of judgment, <hi>God will judge the ſecrets of men by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Now princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are the great ſecrets of men, hid from all but God and a mans own heart. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more latent; they are as the ſpring to a Clock: you ſee the hand move, but that which cauſes the motion is not ſeen. Actions are manifeſt and may be ſeen by all, but principles are ſecret and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by none; but God takes ſtrict no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them and will judge us according to them. Nothing therefore concerns a man more than to ſee that the principles of his obedience be right.</p>
               <p>Now the great principles that a man is acted by, and that carry him on in goſpel obedience are theſe three,
<list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Faith.</hi>

                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Faith.</hi> This is the great principle of all acceptable obedience; without which no obedience can pleaſe God: the Apoſtle is peremptory in it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> And therefore all goſpel obedience is called <hi>the obedience of faith, Rom.</hi> 16.26. There is a twofold obedience to the goſpel.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Obedience to the <hi>call</hi> of the goſpel, whereby fallen ſinners are invited, and by various methods of grace perſwaded to
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:63179:203"/>
return to God and live. Now there can be no obeying the goſpel in this ſenſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith. For how can a man turn from his ſins, and take Chriſt upon the terms of the goſpel, reſigning himſelf to the guidance of his word and ſpirit, without faith?</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is obedience to the <hi>rule</hi> of the goſpel; which directs and guides us how to live and walk ſo as to approve our wayes to God. For the goſpel is not only <hi>the power of God to ſalvation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 1 16.</note> but it is the will of God alſo for our guidance and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; and all obedience to it, as ſuch, is the fruit of faith: Therefore we are ſaid to <hi>live by faith, Gal.</hi> 2.20. and to <hi>walk by faith,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. And living and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing take in the whole courſe of a Chriſtians obedience in the language and ſenſe of the Scripture.</p>
               <p>As the goſpel hath not only its <hi>credenda</hi> but its <hi>agenda,</hi> not only truths to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, but duties to be practiſed; ſo faith hath both a <hi>receptive,</hi> and a <hi>diſpenſing</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty: it <hi>receives</hi> the truths of the goſpel, and imbraces them; 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the word, not as the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the word of God.</hi> And it hath a <hi>diſpenſing</hi> property too, whereby it payes homage to Chriſt in all capacities; it doth not only receive the Law at his mouth as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and reſt upon his merits as a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> but ſubjects to his <hi>yoke</hi> as a <hi>King;</hi> Faith is an active principle, it doth
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:63179:203"/>
as freely ſubmit to the government of Chriſt, as it readily accepts of pardon and ſalvation by him. <hi>By faith Abraham obeyed, Heb</hi> 11.8. This is one principle of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another principle is <hi>love.</hi> And this is of as great importance as the other; nay faith it ſelf is deficient without this, for <hi>faith works by love, Gal.</hi> 5.6. This love as it is the Chriſtians badge and character, (<hi>Let them that love thy name be joyful in thee,</hi> Pſal. 5.11.) So it is the great princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of obedience: The Law being <hi>a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of death;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.7. Eccleſ. 12.13.</note> the great principle of obedience there was <hi>fear. Fear God and keep his commandments:</hi> but the goſpel is <hi>a miniſtration of life and glory,</hi> and the great principle there is <hi>Love; if a man love me he will keep my words,</hi> Joh. 14.23. Love is vertually all obedience, and therefore our Lord Chriſt reduces all the precepts to this, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 22.37, 39.</note> 
                  <hi>and thy neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> So that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Religion is contained in this: It is not <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> as the <hi>Jew</hi> would, nor <hi>uncircumciſion,</hi> as the converted <hi>Gentile</hi> would, <hi>but faith that works by love,</hi> Gal. 5.6.</p>
               <p>There is no ſuch principle of obedience as <hi>Love.</hi> This will be evident if you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der but eight properties of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is an <hi>appretiative</hi> principle, that prefers and values Jeſus Chriſt above all. It
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:63179:204"/>
ſees ſuch a beauty and excellency in him that it counts all <hi>loſs and dung</hi> in compariſon of him.<note place="margin">Phil. 3.8.</note> And he that thus loves Chriſt can't but obey him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Love</hi> is an <hi>opening</hi> principle. <hi>Open to me my ſiſter,</hi> Cant. 5.2. and <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>I ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to my beloved.</hi> Chriſt can have no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the heart if love do not let him in This is the opening grace.</p>
               <p>It is ſo in God the Father. What makes him open his eternal counſels and purpoſes of grace and mercy to poor creatures, but love?</p>
               <p>It is ſo in God the Son. What made him open heaven and come into the world? open the virgins womb and be born? open his ſide and let out his blood, and ſo open <hi>a new and living way for us</hi> to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?<note place="margin">Heb. 10.20.</note> What makes him open his arms to receive returning ſinners, and open the gates of glory for them? but love.</p>
               <p>It is ſo in God the Holy Ghoſt. What makes him open blind eyes, and deaf ears, and hard hearts? but love.</p>
               <p>And look how love works in God to us, ſo it works in us to God; it opens the ear to hearken to him; it opens the mouth to ſpeak for him; it opens the hand to work for him; it opens the heart to entertain and imbrace him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Love</hi> is a <hi>liberal</hi> principle, it is all for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: it is the moſt bountiful affection. Love is all for laying out upon its object. It is ſo
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:63179:204"/>
with God. Divine love expreſſes it ſelf in acts of bounty;<note place="margin">Joh. 3.16. Luk. 11.13. Pſal. 84.11. Heb. 8.10. Epheſ. 2.5.</note> 
                  <hi>God ſo loved the world that he gave his ſon:</hi> He gives Chriſt, He gives his Spirit, He gives grace and glory, He gives himſelf. <hi>I will be their God.</hi> So it is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>He loved us and gave himſelf for us.</hi> And look how love acts in God and Chriſt, ſo it acts in all that are born of God; he that loves God gives all to God; he gives not only his time and ſtrength and talents, but he gives himſelf. <hi>I am my beloveds.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cant. 6.3.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Love</hi> is a <hi>laborious</hi> principle: It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes doing; <hi>Amor neſcit ferias;</hi> it hath no days of leiſure; it ſets all the wheels of the ſoul in motion. And therefore the holy Ghoſt joyns love and labour together. <hi>God is not unrighteous to forget your work, and labour of love, Heb.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Your work of faith and labour of love,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1.3. As the word of God is <hi>objectum practicum,</hi> a thing not only to be known, but obeyed; ſo love is <hi>principium operativum,</hi> not a meer notion ſwimming in the brain, but a devout affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction quickning the heart to obedience. <hi>I have lifted up my hands to thy commandments which I have loved,</hi> Pſal. 119.48.</p>
               <p>If any thing keep a man cloſe to God in duty it is love;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.10.</note> for this will <hi>ſpend and be ſpent;</hi> as it is right in regard of its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, ſo it is laborious in its motion; and doth ſo inlarge the diſpoſitions and reſolutions of the heart for God, that as it
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:63179:205"/>
knows it cannot do enough, ſo it is apt to overlook all it doth as nothing. And this is many times the reaſon of thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints that are found among Chriſtians; that it is not with them as in time paſt; they cannot pray, nor act, nor walk, nor work for God as once they could and did: the complaint ariſes meerly out of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd affection; not becauſe duty is leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened, but becauſe love is increaſed. He that loves but little, will think he doth enough when he doth leaſt; but as love is increaſed, ſo duty will be diminiſhed in our eſteem, though it be inlarged in our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Love</hi> is a <hi>regulated</hi> principle, it acts by rule, and direction. The motions of love are voluntary and free; but its offices and acts are bounded by the commandment. As the Promiſe is the rule of faith, ſo is the Precept the rule of love. Love to God is not a love of equals but of inferiours, and therefore comes under a law; it is our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to act it, but it is Gods prerogative to govern and guide it. The expreſſions of our love are to be wholly regulated by what God requires and commands of us; what ever is done otherwiſe though in the ſervice of God, yet it hath not love for its principle.</p>
               <p>Many ſupererogate in the ſervice of God, and think this love to God, as the Papiſts; and among our ſelves how zealous are many for ceremonies and ſuperſtitious
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:63179:205"/>
obſervances, and think this is their love to God; whereas it is in the language of God himſelf, a hating of him: as you ſee in the ſecond commandment, <hi>Viſiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate me.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 20.5, 6.</note> Who they are that hate him, the former part of the command tells you; they are ſuch as corrupt the worſhip of God by any manner of will worſhip, or humane inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions. Though every ſin hath a degree of hatred of God in it, yet falſe worſhip is in a peculiar manner ſaid to be <hi>a hating of him,</hi> becauſe it is a down right invading the rights of his Soveraignty, to whom alone it belongs to preſcribe how he will be worſhipped; and hence one ſays, it is a leſs ſin in the worſhip of God, not to do what God commands, than to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe what he hath not commanded; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the former we ſhew our weakneſs to do the will of God; but in the latter we ſhew our impudence, in making our ſelves wiſer than God.<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Herein is love that we keep his commandments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Love</hi> is a <hi>commanding</hi> principle, it ſwayes the heart. Every man is acted by the power of love. That which gives ſin its dominion in the ſoul is the love of it: So much as a man loves ſin, ſo much power it hath over the heart; and ſo much as we love Chriſt, ſo much he rules in us; for Chriſt and luſt rule by love. As love to ſin
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:63179:206"/>
abates, the power of ſin decays; and as love to Chriſt increaſes, ſo his intereſt and government advances in the ſoul. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that God beſpeaks us to give him our hearts, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.26. <hi>My ſon give me thy heart,</hi> and to love him with all our hearts, <hi>Matt.</hi> 22.37. Becauſe he knows that if he hath our hearts he hath all.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Love</hi> is an <hi>induring</hi> principle. <hi>It bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things,—indureth all things,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.7. <hi>Jacob</hi> ſerved twice ſeven years for <hi>Rachel,</hi> and indured hard things, and yet the time was ſhort,<note place="margin">Gen. 29.20.</note> and his burden light, all was nothing becauſe of the love he had to her. <hi>Neſcit amor molimina,</hi> love knows no difficulties, how can it when it makes hard things eaſie.</p>
               <p>Is it not a hard thing to keep the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects of the ſoul fixed upon God when he hides from it, or frowns upon it? <hi>Amare Deum cum ſe praebet inimicum.</hi> This <hi>Luther</hi> counted a very hard work; but love makes it eaſie.</p>
               <p>Is it not a hard thing to indure reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and perſecutions for Chriſt? yet love makes it eaſie. <hi>I take pleaſure in reproaches and perſecutions and diſtreſſes for Chriſts ſake,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.10. There is no man can take pleaſure in theſe things for themſelves; no, but <hi>for Chriſts ſake.</hi> It is love to Chriſt that ſweetens all.</p>
               <p>Is it not a hard thing to lay down our lives for Chriſt? and yet love makes it
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:63179:206"/>
eaſie. <hi>I count not my life dear,</hi> ſayes <hi>Paul, ſo that I may finiſh my courſe with joy,</hi> Acts 20.24. <hi>They loved not their lives to the death,</hi> Rev. 12.11. there is no part of Chriſts <hi>Yoke</hi> grievous to love; no duty burthenſom. <hi>Great peace have they that love thy law, and nothing ſhall offend them,</hi> Pſal. 119.165.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Love</hi> is a <hi>laſting</hi> principle. The holy Ghoſt ſayes <hi>it never faileth,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.8. it is ſure to hold out and perſevere to the laſt. Nay it ſhall not only be a principle of obedience in Saints while they are in this world, but in heaven for ever. A be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is acted by ſome principles in the preſent ſtate, that ſhall ceaſe in heaven; but love ſhall never ceaſe; it ſhall be a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of obedience in heaven to Eternity.</p>
               <p>O what an excellent principle of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is love! and therefore ſee that your love to Chriſt be ſincere; and that all your ſervices to Chriſt flow from this principle; for without it all ye do is nothing; <hi>If I give my body to be burned, and have not love, it profits me nothing,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.3.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third principle of obedience to Chriſt is <hi>ſelf denial.</hi> There is a <hi>ſelf denial</hi> before cloſing with Chriſt, which is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in order to the taking up his <hi>Yoke.</hi> As Chriſt finds every ſinner in himſelf, ſo he firſt calls him out of himſelf to cloſe with him. <hi>If any man will come after me let him deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs and follow
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:63179:207"/>
me,</hi> Matt. 16.24. A man muſt come out of himſelf to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And there is <hi>a ſelf denyal</hi> which is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of cloſing with Chriſt; that follows upon our believing, and is an eſſential part of ſanctification; <hi>None of us liveth to himſelf, and no man dyeth to himſelf,</hi> Rom. 14.7. Self-opinion, ſelf-will, ſelf-love, ſelf-confidence, all muſt be denyed; every <hi>imagination,</hi> and every <hi>high thing</hi> muſt be brought <hi>into capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity to the obedience of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.4, 5. Nay <hi>righteous ſelf</hi> too is as much to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed in point of <hi>dependance,</hi> as <hi>carnal ſelf,</hi> is in point of <hi>indulgence;</hi> for truſting to ſelf-righteouſneſs hath undone many. Not only our <hi>unrighteouſneſs</hi> will undo us if we abide init, but our very <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> will undo us alſo if we truſt to it; and why? becauſe hereby we thruſt Chriſt out of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.3.</note> and make void his righteouſneſs. Let your box of oyntment be never ſo preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 10.1.</note> yet this <hi>dead fly</hi> will ſpoil it all. If once <hi>judgment</hi> be <hi>ſent forth to victory</hi> over every thing of ſelf, then art thou prepared for a full ſubjection to the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing a man doth can be called goſpel obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, unleſs it be done from a principle of ſelf-denial: for till then all his duties are but a <hi>ſacrificing to his own net,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hab. 1.16.</note> or as the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> calls it, <hi>a bringing forth fruit to himſelf,</hi> Hoſ. 10.1. Our Lord Chriſt himſelf acted from this principle, for as he did not his own will, ſo he ſought not his own glory.<note place="margin">Joh. 8.50.</note> 
                  <hi>I ſeek not mine own glory, but
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:63179:207"/>
the glory of him that ſent me.</hi> A man can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver carry it becomingly under the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt, nor keep his commandments unleſs he be acted by a principle of ſelf-denial. That is the firſt thing therefore that you are to look to, that the principles of your obedience be right.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you would order your converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on aright under this <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt, ſee that your obedience be in <hi>proper acts and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes.</hi> All that is done in Religion is not obedience; all that is done with reference to God, is not obedience to God. There is a building <hi>wood, and hay,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.12.</note> 
                  <hi>and ſtubble</hi> upon the foundation, this work muſt be all burnt. It is the vanity of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and the wickedneſs of its teachers, to prefer the precepts of men before the commands of Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Matt. 15.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> and ſo to take up the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Antichriſt inſtead of the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt. This obedience, tho done in the name of Chriſt, yet is down right rebellion againſt Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Nothing can be obedience to Chriſt but what is done with reſpect to the authority of the commands of Chriſt. Not this or that ſingle command, but all. Many obey Chriſt in one command, and neglect ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; zealous in ſome things, but muſt he diſpenſed with in others. The <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt doth not conſiſt of any one ſingle obſervance, but is made up of many du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; it is as extenſive as the preceptive part of the goſpel, which comprehends in
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:63179:208"/>
it whatever is in any ſenſe the matter of our duty. The whole government of heart and life, with reſpect to God, to our ſelves, to others, is fully taught by the precepts delivered in the goſpel. And therefore obedience lies not in ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular obſervances as to this or that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but it is an intire and full reſignation of our ſelves to the laws of Chriſt, as they are a rule of guidance and government to the whole man. We muſt have reſpect to all. That obedience that is not univerſal is not real. <hi>Quod propter Deum fit aequaliter fit. I eſteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right,</hi> Pſal. 119.128. <hi>Whatſoever things are true, whatſoever things are honeſt, whatſoever things are juſt, whatſoever things are pure, whatſoever things are lovely, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praiſe, think on theſe things,</hi> Phil. 4.8.</p>
               <p>But yet, there is a preference in the commands of Chriſt; ſome are greater then others; there are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the <hi>weightier matters of the law;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 23.23.</note> Some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are more eſſential to piety, others are more circumſtantial. Some wherein the glory of God, and the ſalvation of the ſoul are more immediately concerned; in others more remotely. Some precepts there are wherein the vitals and main parts of religion are contained, there are others that are but as fences about theſe. And
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:63179:208"/>
therefore though every command is to be <hi>obeyed,</hi> yet ſome are to be <hi>preferred.</hi> Though it is a duty to reſpect all, yet not with the ſame degree of reſpect Though the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are all equal in regard of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the law-giver; yet in reſpect of the things commanded, there is a difference and diſproportion. To <hi>love God</hi> is a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er duty than to <hi>love my neighbour. To obey is better then ſacrifice, and to hearken then the fat of rams,</hi> 1 Sam. 15 22. <hi>I will have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and not ſacrifice,</hi> Matt. 9.13.</p>
               <p>Now then if you would have your obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience manifeſted in proper acts and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, then obſerve theſe ſix rules.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Neglect no duty in its ſeaſon; ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſeaſons have their ſeveral duties annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them by God, which makes them more a duty then any other duty. That which is the duty in ſeaſon is greater than any other duty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Where God layes moſt weight there we are to expreſs moſt care. As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Where any commandment is called great, there God layes great weight; <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy mind, this is the firſt and great commandment,</hi> Matt. 22.37, 38. Therefore this ought to have our firſt and greateſt obſervance.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Where God gives forth commands with the greateſt ſanctions, and ſevereſt
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:63179:209"/>
penalties, there he layes great weight; and there we ſhould expreſs great care. So in the ſecond commandment; there you have a ſanction conſiſting of a ſore threat, and a ſweet promiſe: <hi>Viſiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, and ſhewing mercy to thouſands of them that love me and keep my commandments.</hi> Therefore of all ſins we ſhould take heed of falſe worſhip, and idolatry, for this God abhors: and keep cloſe to divine inſtitution in all reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious performances.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Where two duties come together, there the greater is to take place of the leſs. <hi>Agendum eſt id quod eſt major obligatio.</hi> In this caſe that which is the leſſer duty ceaſes for that time to be a duty; and the greater duty becomes the only duty.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>poſitive</hi> precepts are to give place to <hi>moral</hi> precepts. Though I am commanded to keep the Sabbath and do no work; yet for preſerving my neighbours life, or houſe when on fire, I may as lawfully work on that day as any other.</p>
               <p>And in <hi>moral</hi> precepts; the <hi>leſs</hi> is to give place to the <hi>greater.</hi> Thus when the firſt and the fifth command meet; <hi>(obey God, and obey your rulers.)</hi> the firſt is to take place. The power of a delegate is not to be own'd in competition with the authority of God. <hi>In praeſentia majoris ceſſat poteſtas minoris.</hi> In this caſe ſuperiours are not to be obeyed. For no command of ſuperiours
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:63179:209"/>
can bind againſt the command of God, who is higher then the higheſt.</p>
               <p>Again; when my own <hi>temporal good,</hi> and the <hi>ſpiritual good</hi> of another meet in competition, I am to prefer his <hi>ſpiritual good</hi> before my own <hi>temporal good.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Paul</hi> would rather <hi>never eat meat,</hi> then <hi>offend</hi> his Brothers conſcience. This is the meaning of that in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>We ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.</hi> That is, our corporal lives for their ſpiritual. As in time of perſecution, when the death of the ſtrong may confirm the ſaith of the weak, and ſo be a ſervice to the ſalvation of others; then we ought not to count our lives dear.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. When <hi>external duties</hi> are commanded, <hi>internal obedience</hi> is therein required and chiefly intended. For every precept is given to the whole man; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore binds the inward man as well as the outward, or elſe we are obliged to be hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, and ſeem what we are not. When we are commanded to <hi>repent;</hi> to <hi>hear,</hi> to <hi>pray,</hi> to <hi>do good works,</hi> they are not the outward acts only that Chriſt calls for; but the inward graces and affections. And therefore you never obey the precept, whatever duties you perform, unleſs they be done <hi>in ſpirit and truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. Obſerve the ſtation and condition God hath ſet thee in, and the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thou art under, and attend to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof. For that which is the duty
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:63179:210"/>
of one may not be the duty of another: and that which is a great duty at one time, may be no duty at another. One man may be a Magiſtrate, another a Miniſter, and ſo may be obliged to thoſe duties which are no du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to another.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Laſtly, whatever duties conduce moſt to Gods glory; whatever have the greateſt tendency to our own ſalvation, and the ſalvation of others; whatever may put the greateſt honour upon religion, and render it lovely among men, and <hi>put to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence the ignorance of the fooliſh:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.15.</note> in theſe things lye the proper acts and exerciſes of obedience. And therefore theſe are the works chiefly to be attended to by all that are under the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt: but we muſt not ſo be concerned in the greateſt, as to neglect the leaſt. <hi>Qui minima ſpernit paula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim decidit.</hi> Spiritual decays begin in the neglect of leſſer duties. Remember that of Chriſt to the hypocritical Phariſees: <hi>Theſe ye ought to have done, and not to leave the other undone,</hi> Matt. 23.23. And that in Matt. 5.19. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall break one of theſe leaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, ſhall be called the leaſt in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. If you would carry it becomingly under the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt, as you muſt look that the principles of your obedience be right; and that the matter of your obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience be in right exerciſes: ſo you muſt ſee to the <hi>manner</hi> of your obedience. It is not the bare doing what God commands that is obedience, unleſs it be done in a
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:63179:210"/>
                  <hi>right manner.</hi> Moſt men miſcarry herein; taking up in a bare performance of duty, and reſting <hi>in opere operato,</hi> in the work done, Like the blind Papiſts, that bead out their devotions, and ſerve God by tale. How few watch over their hearts in duty, or look to the frame of their ſpirits in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: whereas this is the great thing God looks at. And therefore the precept doth not only direct in the <hi>matter</hi> to be done, but alſo in the <hi>manner</hi> of doing: not only <hi>what,</hi> but <hi>how. Take heed how ye hear,</hi> Luke 8.18. <hi>Take heed ye do not your alms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men,</hi> Matt. 6.1.</p>
               <p>Now what doth our Lord Chriſt mean by theſe <hi>take heeds?</hi> but to ſhew us how poſſible it is for a man to miſcarry in the very doing of duty, if he do not make as much conſcience, and ſhew as much care in the <hi>manner</hi> of doing, as in the <hi>matter</hi> to be done. <hi>Malum ex quolibet defectu.</hi> Tho all requiſites muſt concur to make an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on morally good, yet any defect makes a good thing evil. And therefore in all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of obedience the manner is careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be attended to. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. This is the great diſtinguiſhing cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter between a true believer and an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite. It is not in the matter done, but in the manner of doing. both may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in one and the ſame duty: and yet it may be an act of grace in one, and an act of ſin in the other. The good man prays; ſo doth the hypocrite; but the one prayes
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:63179:211"/>
                  <hi>with faith and fervency;</hi> the other <hi>draws nigh to God with his lips,</hi> when the <hi>heart is far from him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 15.8.</note> The good man ſerves God; ſo doth the hypocrite: but the one brings the <hi>male of the flock;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mal. 1.13.</note> the other brings the <hi>torn,</hi> and the <hi>lame,</hi> and the <hi>ſick.</hi> The one ſerves him <hi>deceitfully;</hi> the other <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 12.28.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. A duty that is <hi>materially</hi> good, may be <hi>formally</hi> evil by failing in a right maner. Good becomes evil, and duty is turned into ſin by an undue manner of performance. <hi>It is iniquity even the ſolemn meeeting, Iſa.</hi> 1.13.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It makes God diſown his own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, and reject the very perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances which the precept makes a duty. <hi>When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand to tread my courts?</hi> Iſa. 1.12. It was Gods requirement, as you may ſee, Deut. 12.5. <hi>To the place which the Lord your God ſhall chooſe to put his name there, to his habitation ſhall ye ſeek, and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye ſhall come.</hi> So that they had the command of God for treading his Courts; and yet here God rejects his own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Who hath required this at your hand?</hi> Though God required it, yet not of ſuch as they were; nor in ſuch a manner as they appeared. So in v. 13. <hi>Bring no more vain oblations, incenſe is an abomination to me.</hi> But were not theſe oblations and incenſe of Gods own inſtitution?

               <p n="1">1. With reſpect to the <hi>ſubject,</hi> it muſt be the obedience of the whole man.

               <p n="3">III. It muſt be an <hi>upright</hi> and <hi>ſincere</hi> obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. <hi>Walk before me and be thou perfect, Gen.</hi> 17.1. in the margent it is, <hi>be thou ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, or upright.</hi> So that ſincerity and upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is new covenant perfection. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of grace in heaven is <hi>glory;</hi> but the perfection of grace on earth is <hi>ſincerity.</hi> One dram of this in the heart is worth a world. It is that which God delights in; <hi>Thou trieſt the heart, and haſt pleaſure in uprightneſs,</hi> 1 Chron. 29.17. Nay he doth not only delight in uprightneſs; but in the perſons and performances of the upright. <hi>The upright in their way are his delight,</hi> Prov. 11.20. there you ſee his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to their perſons; and from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, this delight of God paſſeth to their performances. <hi>The prayer of the upright is his delight, Prov.</hi> 15.8. God can take no pleaſure in any duty without ſincerity; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all duties that are not done in ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity are a lye. It is ſaid of thoſe Iſraelites in Pſal 78.34, 36, 37. When <hi>they ſought God, and returned, and inquired early after him,</hi> that they did but <hi>lye to him with their tongues,</hi> and why? Becauſe <hi>their hearts were not right with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="403" facs="tcp:63179:214"/>It is <hi>ſincerity</hi> that commends every du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God. It ſupplies all other defects: denominates a man a Saint under all his fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: it is the only ſoyl wherein grace takes root, and grows proſperouſly: It is that one thing wherein only the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an can outſtrip the hypocrite; it is that which crowns all grace with perſeverance. No wonder therefore that the Apoſtle is ſo earneſt with God for this grace in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of that Church, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.9, 10. <hi>Now this I pray—that ye may be ſincere.</hi> And that <hi>David</hi> applies himſelf ſo earneſtly to God upon this account, as he doth, Pſal. 119.80. <hi>Make my heart ſound in thy ſtatutes, that I be not aſhamed.</hi> Hypocriſie ends in ſhame; it is the glory of a Chriſtians obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience when it is done in <hi>ſincerity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. It muſt be a <hi>conſtant</hi> obedience. Tho there may (through the ſtrength of remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing luſts, &amp; the imperfections of grace) poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be many particular unevenneſſes, and ſinful deviations in the courſe of the ſaints obedience, as it was in <hi>Noah, Lot, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Peter, &amp;c.</hi> yet in the main,<note place="margin">Job 17.9.</note> he holds on his way. <hi>I have inclined my heart to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form thy ſtatutes alwayes to the end,</hi> Pſal. 119.112. Not by pangs and fits, but <hi>alwayes;</hi> not for a time, and then draw back, but <hi>to the end. Judas</hi> was a diſciple, and put on Chriſts <hi>Yoke</hi> for a while: but <hi>Satan</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the <hi>Yoke</hi> is caſt off. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> takes up Chriſts <hi>Yoke</hi> for a fit; but,<note place="margin">Acts 8.21.</note> his
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:63179:215"/>
heart not being right with God, he ſoon caſts it off again.</p>
               <p>There is a great deal of this volatile devotion in the world. Many take up Chriſts <hi>Yoke early,</hi> and caſt it off again as <hi>ſuddainly:</hi> their <hi>goodneſs is</hi> (as was ſaid of <hi>Ephraims</hi>) Hoſ. 6.4. <hi>as a morning cloud, and as the early dew that goes away.</hi> Or like the new moon, that ſhines a while in the firſt part of the night; but is down, and diſappears before half the night be gone. But <hi>bleſſed are they that keep judgment, and he that doth righteouſneſs at all times,</hi> Pſal. 106.3. Now when obedience is thus circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced; when it is done <hi>willingly, fully, ſincerely,</hi> and <hi>conſtantly;</hi> then it is done in a right manner.</p>
               <p n="4">4. See that your obedience to Chriſt hath <hi>right ends,</hi> it is a known maxim, <hi>non actibus ſed finibus penſantur officia.</hi> Duties are not weighed and eſteemed ſo much by acts as by ends. Though a <hi>good end</hi> cannot juſtifie a <hi>bad action,</hi> yet the beſt action is corrupted by a bad end. <hi>Jehu</hi> is imployed in a good work; a work well pleaſing to God; a work to which he was called of God;<note place="margin">2 King, 9.6, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> the deſtroying the houſe of idolatrous <hi>Ahab.</hi> And yet when he had done it, God threatens to <hi>avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the houſe of Jehu,</hi> Hoſ. 1.4. God firſt anoints <hi>Jehu</hi> for that work, to ſhed the blood of the houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and then bid him go and do it: and
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:63179:215"/>
then declareth his acceptance of it when done: (2 King. 10.30. <hi>Thou haſt done well in executiting that which is right in mine eyes</hi>) yea promiſeth to reward him for doing it;<note place="margin">2 King, 10.30.</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe thou haſt done to the houſe of Ahab all that was in mine heart, thy children of the fourth generation ſhall ſit on the throne of Iſrael,</hi> and yet after all this threatens to avenge this blood upon <hi>Jehu's</hi> houſe. What ſhould be the reaſon of this? Becauſe though the work was good, yet <hi>Jehu's end</hi> was bad. It was not done in zeal for the Lord as he pretended,<note place="margin">2 King. 10.16.</note> but his end was to get the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. I obſerve hence two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A man may poſſibly do that very thing which is commanded by God, and yet not do the will of God. He may ſerve his own luſts in doing what God requires.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God may reward a work in this world, and yet puniſh it in the next. A work may be materially good, and ſo may have a reward here; and yet our end in it may be carnal and corrupt; and for that God may puniſh it hereafter. It is a very miſchievous thing for a man to ſubject a good work to <hi>bad ends;</hi> Our Saviour ſpeaks of ſome that <hi>pray to be ſeen of men,</hi> Matt. 6.5. and that <hi>devour widows houſes, and for a pretence make long prayers,</hi> (Matt. 23.14.) a <hi>bad end</hi> to a good action. And what follows, <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye ſhall receive the greater damnation.</hi>

What work more ſpiritual? what <hi>end</hi> more <hi>carnal?</hi> this is proſtituting Religion to ſerve our luſts; and ſo make Gods ſtream to turn the devils mill. Or as if we did ſet up another God beſides him, as every carnal man doth: for he that hath no <hi>higher end</hi> in all his actions than himſelf, is a God to himſelf. Hence it is that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and falſe Teachers are ſaid to <hi>make their belly their God,</hi>

                  <pb n="407" facs="tcp:63179:216"/>2.

               </q>
               <p>A man cannot call his moſt ſpiritual acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, an action of grace, unleſs he doth it to a <hi>holy end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>True wiſdom lies in three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In propounding and fixing a right end.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the choſing proper and ſuitable means.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In a diligent uſe of theſe means to the attaining to this end: and you have all theſe pointed at in that of the Apoſtle, Phil. 1.11. <hi>Being filled with the fruits of righteouſneſs, which are by Jeſus Chriſt to the praiſe and glory of God. Fruits of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> muſt be our work: as the means which muſt be done <hi>by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> by whom we have ſtrength for performance. And they muſt be done <hi>to the praiſe and glory of God</hi> as our end.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is nothing in our beſt duties and performances that can any way ſtead us to communion with God, unleſs our <hi>end</hi> be <hi>good.</hi> One <hi>end</hi> in all duties is to obtain
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:63179:217"/>
communion with God. There is <hi>Commerce</hi> and <hi>Communion: Commerce</hi> is when one man Trades with another for private advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; and ſo a man will maintain <hi>commerce</hi> with a ſtranger, or an enemy. But <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> ſuppoſes <hi>love</hi> and <hi>delight</hi> in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. A carnal man may have <hi>commerce</hi> with God in duties for ſelfiſh ends; as they that followed Chriſt for the <hi>loaves:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 6.26.</note> but a man can have no <hi>communion</hi> with God in duty unleſs his <hi>ends</hi> be <hi>right.</hi> He puts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſeven times farther from God by an unholy <hi>end,</hi> than by a <hi>holy action</hi> he ſeemed to draw nigh to him.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>ends</hi> therefore are to be narrowly looked unto. The beſt action is corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a <hi>bad end:</hi> and our civil and natural actions have a holineſs upon them, and are tinctured with religion, when they are done to a <hi>right end.</hi> Therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle counſelling ſervants in their duty to man, bids them make the glory of Chriſt their <hi>end,</hi> Epheſ. 6.5. <hi>Servants be obedient to your maſters — in ſingleneſs of heart as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt.</hi> And ver. 6. <hi>Not with eye-ſervice as men pleaſers, but as the ſervants of Chriſt.</hi> And again, ver. 7. <hi>With good will doing ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice as to the Lord, and not to men.</hi> The great deſign of the Apoſtle's counſel is to ſublimate and enoble their ends: that the meaneſt act of their ſervile ſtate may reach to Chriſt. Be obedient <hi>as unto Chriſt.</hi> And <hi>as the ſervants of Christ;</hi> and <hi>as to the Lord.</hi> What ever a man doth, whether
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:63179:217"/>
in civil or ſpiritual performances, if his ends be not right, his heart cannot be right.</p>
               <p>There is a twofold end in obedience, which commends it to God: the one is <hi>ſubordinate</hi> to the other as the <hi>ultimate.</hi> The <hi>ſubordinate end</hi> is the honour and credit of the goſpel, the good of our neighbour, the edification of the Church; and our own ſalvation: That when we have done all, we be not <hi>caſt awayes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.27. 2 <hi>Ep.</hi> Joh. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>loſing all that we have wrought: but that we receive a full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi> Then there is the <hi>ultimate end</hi> of our obedience: and that is the honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, which is the chief end of all. <hi>Whether ye eat or drink, or whatever ye do, do all to the glory of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.31. If the ſtream of every action empty not it ſelf into the ſea of Gods glory, it runs waſt. This is the mark of a hypocrite, <hi>ſelf love</hi> is his <hi>higheſt principle,</hi> and <hi>ſelf-ſeeking</hi> is his <hi>utmoſt end.</hi> But the Chriſtians true character is in this; <hi>Love to God</hi> is the <hi>great principle</hi> he acts by; and the <hi>glory of God</hi> is the <hi>great end</hi> he aims at.</p>
               <p>I might here anſwer a caſe of conſcience,<note place="margin">Caſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note> whether a man ought alwayes actually to intend his ultimate end? that is, whether he ought to have his eye continually upon the glorifying of God in every particular duty which he performs?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Affirmative precepts though they <hi>alwayes</hi> bind, yet they bind not <hi>to all times.</hi>
                  <pb n="410" facs="tcp:63179:218"/>
now this being a duty by virtue of an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative precept, it is alwayes a duty, yet not abſolutely neceſſary in every particular act. Indeed as the affirmative doth include a negative, ſo it binds <hi>ad ſemper,</hi> to all times; ſo that we muſt at no time do any thing againſt Gods glory, that may reflect any diſhonour upon him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is need of a diſtinction for the fuller reſolution of this caſe. Aims and intentions with reſpect to their end are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>habitual,</hi> or <hi>actual,</hi> or <hi>virtual.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Habitual.</hi> The work of grace in the heart is to change and ſublimate our <hi>end;</hi> ſo that wherever grace is, there is an <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual</hi> ſcope and aim at Gods glory as the end of all obedience. But this is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is an <hi>actual</hi> aim at the glory of God in each particular performance. Now this cannot be the duty of a believer in his preſent imperfect ſtate, for three rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe it would leave no place for other duties.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is not abſolutely neceſſary in every particular act: though it ought to be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently done, yet it is not ſo neceſſary in every duty as that it ceaſes to be an act of obedience if it be not <hi>actually</hi> done. If a man make a voyage to the <hi>Indies,</hi> his aim and deſign is to be there in ſuch a time, and accordingly he ſets ſail in purſuance of
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:63179:218"/>
his end. Yet his end is not in his <hi>eye,</hi> in every action he doth in ſteering and guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the veſſel. So it is in this caſe: The deſign of a Chriſtian is the glory of God in all his actions, though he may not <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> aim at it in every particular perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is impoſſible to perform it where there is a conſtant luſting of the fleſh againſt the ſpirit, as is in every believer;<note place="margin">Gal. 5.17.</note> and therefore a further work of grace muſt paſs upon the regenerate ſoul then can be attained in this ſtate, to enable it hereto; and that is in glorification, whereby grace is compleated and freed from all mixtures of fleſh, and interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in its acts by temptation. Saints in heaven do <hi>actually</hi> intend the glory of God in every thing they do; and no wonder, for they <hi>ſee face to face.</hi> They are held cloſe to God by an immediate and uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted viſion. Therefore the holy Ghoſt puts theſe two, ſight and ſervice together, Revel. 22.3, 4. <hi>His ſervants ſhall ſerve him, and they ſhall ſee his face.</hi> They ſhall ſerve him, ſo they do here; I but there they ſhall ſerve him perfectly, with purity of intention, and compleatneſs of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and how ſo? they ſhall ſee him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately and injoy him fully. God is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver perfectly ſerved till he is fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a <hi>virtual</hi> aim and intention, which is more then <hi>habitual.</hi> And though
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:63179:219"/>
it is not <hi>actual,</hi> yet the action hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſuch a tendency as naturally referrs to the glory of God. He that in alms-giving <hi>actually</hi> intends the good and comfort of his poor neighbour, doth therein <hi>virtually</hi> aim at the glory of God. When a man by his repentance, and mourning for ſin, <hi>actually</hi> aims at the obtaining of pardon and forgiveneſs, the tendency of his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to an end ſubordinate to the glory of God. For it is the glory of God to forgive ſin. So then I would reſolve the caſe thus.</p>
               <p>To intend the glory of God <hi>habitually,</hi> is not enough for a believer to do. To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it in every particular duty <hi>actually,</hi> is more then a believer can do. But to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it in each duty <hi>virtually,</hi> and as oft as we can <hi>actually,</hi> this is a believers preſent duty: and obedience thus performed ſhall certainly find acceptation with God. And ſo much for the ſecond direction, to ſuch as are under Chriſts <hi>Yoke;</hi> that they would labour to bear it becomingly: which is done when obedience is from <hi>right princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;</hi> and conſiſts in <hi>proper performances;</hi> and all is done in a <hi>due manner;</hi> to a <hi>right end.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>HAving put on the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Duty third.</note> never caſt it off again. Having begun in the ſpirit do not end in the fleſh, <hi>He that puts his hand to the plough and looks back, is not fit for the Kingdom of God,</hi> Luk. 9.62. <hi>Art thou bound</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaies in another caſe) <hi>ſeek not to be looſed.</hi> The <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt is to be put on betimes, but never to be put off again. The goſpel, that puts this <hi>yoke</hi> upon us, is the <hi>everlaſting goſpel;</hi> not temporary, or ceſſant,<note place="margin">Rev. 14.6.</note> but a fixed rule for the whole life; and therefore we are to <hi>ſerve God in righteouſneſs and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs all our dayes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk, 1.74, 75.</note> Let me propound ſome arguments to preſs this duty; and then ſome directions to help in it, and I ſhall diſmiſs this branch of the uſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider the great advantage of a perſevering obedience; whether you look at the honour that attends it, or the peace that comes by it, or the ſafety that is in it, or the reward that is intailed upon it, the advantage is great on all theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="414" facs="tcp:63179:220"/>1. It is your honour to perſevere in your obedience to Chriſt to the end. This is clearly intimated in that counſel of Chriſt to the Church of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> Revel. 2.11. <hi>Hold that faſt which thou haſt that no man take thy crown.</hi> The Crown here ſome take for the crown of glory in heaven. Others take it for that honour God had put upon her <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>I will make them of the Synagogue of Satan, who ſay they are Jews and are not—to come and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.</hi> But I take her crown here, to be her <hi>perſeverance</hi> in faith and obedience to Chriſt; for <hi>perſeverance</hi> is a Chriſtians crown; it crowns all grace; therefore ſaith our Lord Chriſt, <hi>hold faſt that which thou haſt.</hi> That profeſſion thou haſt made, that grace thou haſt received, that obedience which thou haſt wrought, <hi>For I know thy works, thou haſt a little ſtrength, and haſt kept my word, and haſt not denyed my name. Hold faſt that which thou haſt;</hi> there is the counſel of Chriſt: and the argument he urgeth it upon is, leaſt ſhe ſhould loſe her Crown. Perſeverance in the wayes of Chriſt is the crown and honour of a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you reſpect the peace and comfort of your ſtate, nothing ſecures and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes it more then your conſtancy in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience As there is a peace which flows from juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. ſo there is a peace reſulting from perſevering obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:63179:220"/>
                  <hi>Great peace have they that love thy Law,</hi> Pſal. 119.165. He don't ſay only, that do it, but that love it; for he that loves it will do it, and never depart from it, Gal. 6.16. <hi>As many as walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this rule, peace ſhall be upon them and mercy.</hi> Conſtant obedience brings in conſtant peace and comfort.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is of great advantage in point of ſafety. <hi>Righteouſneſs keepeth him that is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in the way, but wickedneſs overthroweth the ſinner,</hi> Prov. 13.6. Ah what fools are ſinners, who run into ſin to avoid ſuffering; it is as if a man ſhould venture his head to ſave his hat: or ſink the Ship to avoid the ſtorm. It is <hi>He that keepeth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment that keepeth his own ſoul,</hi> Prov. 19.16. There is no ſafty but in the way of duty. We are ſure of Gods protection ſo long as we make conſcience of Gods precepts. So ſayes the Prophet, Iſa 33.15, 16. <hi>He that walketh uprightly—he ſhall dwell on high, his place of defence ſhall be the munitions of Rocks.</hi> And Prov. 1.33. <hi>Whoſo hearkneth to me ſhall dwell ſafely, and ſhall be quiet from fear of evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. It is your advantage in point of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The promiſes are made to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance. <hi>To them who by patient continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in well doing ſeek for glory, and honour and immortality, eternal life,</hi> Rom 2.7. The date of your ſervice is ſhort, but eternity is the date of your recompence. So that
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:63179:221"/>
great is the advantage of your keeping cloſe to Chriſt in the way of obedience, and therefore <hi>he that is righteous, let him be righteous ſtill, and he that is holy, let him be holy ſtill,</hi> Rev. 22.11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider on the other hand the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and miſchief of Apoſtacy from Chriſt. As perſeverance in his ſervice is attended with great advantages; ſo caſting off his <hi>yoke</hi> hath in it very miſchievous effects; and that both with reſpect to Jeſus Chriſt and to our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="1">1. With reſpect to Chriſt. It is the greateſt reproach that can be laid upon Chriſt for any one that hath taken up his <hi>yoke</hi> to caſt it off again. For it is a leaving and rejecting him after <hi>choice, profeſſion, and experience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Subjection to Chriſts <hi>yoke</hi> is an act of <hi>choice;</hi> for Chriſt forceth none into his ſervice. Now choice is of the beſt things. Of evils a man chooſeth the leaſt, but of good things a man chooſeth that which is beſt. So that he that chooſeth the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Chriſt doth therein acknowledge the goodneſs and beauty of his ways. And therefore for a man to caſt off his <hi>yoke</hi> is to repent of his choice. And this is a great reproach to Jeſus Chriſt for a man to chooſe his precepts, and afterwards to reject them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Caſting off the <hi>yoke</hi> is a forſaking Chriſt after an open <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> for there
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:63179:221"/>
can be no Apoſtacy, but by ſuch as have firſt owned Chriſt, and made a profeſſion of him; the drunkard, the unclean wretch &amp;c. that hath been vile all his days, liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a courſe of ſin from his youth up, he can't be ſaid properly to be an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate; if he lives and dyes in his ſins and luſts, he may be ſaid to live and dye a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, but no Apoſtate. But he is an Apoſtate that hath known and owned the wayes of Chriſt, and afterward turned the back upon them; that hath given his neck to the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt, and then caſt it off again; that hath vomited up his filthineſs, and then turned to his own vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit again, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. Such an Apoſtate was <hi>Judas, Demas,</hi> &amp;c. Now for a man to take up a profeſſed ſubjection to Chriſt, and then forſake him muſt needs be a great reproach, for he ſeems to ſay that he is not a good Maſter, it is no profit to ſerve him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is a leaving Chriſt after <hi>experience;</hi> for there is no man that hath taken up Chriſts <hi>Yoke,</hi> but hath ſeen an equity and goodneſs in his Precepts; he hath found ſome peace of Conſcience in ſo doing; he hath <hi>taſted</hi> ſomewhat <hi>of the Heavenly gift,</hi> and <hi>been made partaker of</hi> ſome operations <hi>of the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>taſted the good word of God, and the powers of the World to come.</hi> Heb. 6.4, 5. Now for a man to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of Chriſt, and then caſt him off, is the greateſt reproach that can be caſt
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:63179:222"/>
upon him. The Apoſtle calls it a <hi>Crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Son of God afreſh,</hi> and <hi>putting him to open ſhame.</hi> Heb. 6.6. It is a leſs evil to refuſe the firſt tenders of grace, then to reject Chriſt after he hath been profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and own'd; the former may be from ignorance and prejudice, but to caſt him off upon tryal, argues his <hi>yoke</hi> to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy, and his Commandments grievous, he ſayes in the language of his action, there is not that good to be found in God as he expected, nor that comfort in his ways as was promiſed. And what great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er contempt can be put upon Chriſt then this?</p>
               <p n="2">2. It hath miſchievous effects with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) It proves the unſoundneſs and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie of our hearts; and ſhews they were never right with God. <hi>They went out from us, but they were not of us, for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us, but they went out that they might be made manifeſt that they were not all of us.</hi> 1 Joh. 2.19. He that at any time ſhall caſt off the <hi>yoke</hi> of Chriſt, ſhews that his heart was never right in taking of it up. In a Marriage relation love increaſes and firms the bond, but adulterous love is only hot while new.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="419" facs="tcp:63179:222"/>(2.) Another miſchievous effect is in thoſe unſpeakable loſſes we ſuſtain by caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off Chriſts <hi>yoke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. A loſs of all we have done or ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Chriſt, <hi>when the righteous turneth away from his righteouſneſs, and committeth iniquity, — all his Righteouſneſs that he hath done ſhall not be mentioned.</hi> Ezekiel 18.24. thy Faith, thy Prayers, thy Alms-deeds, thy Faſtings, thy ſtriving againſt ſin, thy zeal and fervour for Chriſt, will all come to nothing; <hi>it ſhall never be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,</hi> all thy labour, and obedience, and duties are loſt, though they have been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo many and great. When a <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi> under the Law had ſeparated himſelf to the Lord, if any defilement came upon him, all was loſt, and counted for nothing. <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.12. <hi>He ſhall conſecrate to the Lord the days of his ſeparation,</hi> (that is, he ſhall begin all again) <hi>but the days that were before ſhall be loſt, becauſe his ſeparation was defiled.</hi> So it is with profeſſors of Religion, if they draw back all is loſt; <hi>In Chriſtianis non initia quaeruntur, ſed finis.</hi> It is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly how we begin, but how we finiſh. And therefore it is excellent counſel the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle gives,<note place="margin">2 Epiſt. <hi>Joh.</hi> ver. 8.</note> 2 Epiſt. Joh. <hi>Look to your ſelves that ye loſe not thoſe things which yee have wrought.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. A loſs of that honour and reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which doth ever attend ſincerity and perſeverance: as an Apoſtate loſes the
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:63179:223"/>
profit and comfort of all his duties, ſo he loſes the honour of his profeſſion. <hi>Ye did run well, who hindered you?</hi> Gal. 5.7. <hi>Demas hath forſaken us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.10.</note> 
                  <hi>and imbraced this preſent world:</hi> it is recorded as an act of perpetual infamy and diſhonour. So Chriſt ſaith of him that begins to build, and is not able to finiſh, that <hi>all that behold it ſhall mock at him, ſaying, This man began to build and was not able to finiſh.</hi> Luk. 14.29, 30. The Crown of profeſſion is only ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by perſeverance, <hi>Hold faſt that which thou haſt that no man take thy Crown.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ne honorem perſeverantiae amittas. <hi>Gro.</hi>
                  </note> Revel. 3.11.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A loſs of gifts and parts, and of that expediteneſs for ſervice which we once had. When men withdraw from, and forſake Chriſt, he cauſes his Spirit in his wonted operations and influences to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from, and forſake them; So that they are not the men they once were. How hath the experience of the preſent Age verified this. Do we not ſee many that once had great gifts of the Spirit for pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, teaching, and edifying of others, who by turning their backs upon Chriſt to a dead way of formal Worſhip, have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned away the gifts of the Spirit, and are now become utterly dead and lifeleſs? and thus is that of our Lord made good, Mark 4.25. <hi>He that hath not,</hi> (not improved) <hi>from him ſhall be taken away that which he hath.</hi> Thus Chriſt took away the Talent from the unprofitable <hi>ſervant.</hi> Mat. 25.28.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="421" facs="tcp:63179:223"/>4. A loſs of that tenderneſs of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which is neceſſary to a true repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; for when a man doth reject, and caſt off Chriſts <hi>yoke,</hi> uſually Conſcience is laid waſt, it is ſinned out of office, and ſo lets a man ſin on without check or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul. And how ſhall that man repent who hath ſinned away all tenderneſs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience? therefore the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>It is impoſſible if ſuch fall away, to renew them again to Repentance.</hi> Heb. 6.4, 6.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A loſs of Heaven and the ſalvation of their ſouls. There are two ſorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that are for ever ſhut out of Heaven. Such as never believed, and ſuch as make Shipwrack of Faith. Such as never would take up the <hi>yoke</hi> of Chriſt, and ſuch as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken it up, do finally caſt it off again. <hi>If you forſake God, he will forſake you;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Chron. 15.2.</note> This is willful ſinning, and how dreadful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath God expreſſed himſelf againſt this. Heb. 10.26. <hi>If we ſin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the Truth, there remaineth no more Sacrifice for ſins, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation, which ſhall devour the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries:</hi> you therefore that have taken up the <hi>yoke</hi> of Chriſt, let that ſevere threatening of Chriſt faſten it for ever upon you. Mark 8.38. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall be aſhamed of me, and of my words in this adulterous and ſinful generation, of him ſhall the ſon of man be aſhamed when he cometh in the glory of the Father, with his Holy Angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="422" facs="tcp:63179:224"/>Theſe are the Arguments, the Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 1. Would you not caſt off Chriſts <hi>Yoke?</hi> Then do not be weary of his ſervice. Do not count it burdenſome. No man loves to bear what is burdenſome; it makes him weary; and wearyneſs cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth fainting. Hence that of the Apoſtle, Heb. 12.3. <hi>Conſider him that indured ſuch contradiction of ſinners againſt himſelf, leſt ye be weary and faint in your minds.</hi> There is a wearineſs from <hi>contrariety of Spirit</hi> to the work.<note place="margin">Mal. 1.13.</note> 
                  <hi>Ye have ſaid, what a wearineſs is it?</hi> And there is a wearineſs from <hi>deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of Spirit</hi> under diſcouragements in the ways of God, by reaſon of contradictions and ſufferings: but nothing ſhould make us weary of Chriſts work.<note place="margin">Gal. 6.9.</note> 
                  <hi>Be not weary of well-doing.</hi> 2 Theſ. 3.13. Chriſt ſpeaks it to the commendation of that Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> Rev. 2:3. <hi>For my name ſake thou haſt laboured, and haſt not fainted.

This Scripture hath occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned a great queſtion, and that is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Demas</hi> was a good man or an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite? whether his Apoſtacy was final, or whether he did repent of his fall?</p>
               <p>Some are of opinion that he was a good man; and that though the love of the world prevailed upon him, to leave the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in his troubles, and to mind his preſent advantages, yet he afterward repented of his ſin, and returned to the Apoſtle again. And the ground of this opinion is from two Scriptures. One is, Col. 4.14. <hi>Luke the beloved Phyſitian, and Demas greet you,</hi> the other is <hi>Philemon</hi> 24. <hi>There ſalute thee Epaphras my Fellow-Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in Chriſt Jeſus, Marcus, Ariſtarcus, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas.</hi> Therefore ſay they, <hi>Demas</hi> his fall was but partial; and though he fell, yet he aroſe again.</p>
               <p>But how weakly this opinion is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed appears in this; that both thoſe Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> and <hi>Philemon</hi> were written before this ſecond Epiſtle to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy;</hi> which was written when <hi>Paul</hi> was in Bonds at <hi>Rome</hi> the ſecond time, as the concluſion of the Epiſtle (which was but a few Months before his death) doth make manifeſt.

In all probability therefore <hi>Demas</hi> was but an Hypocrite, who made a profeſſion for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ends; and ſuch a one can never perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in the ways of Chriſt.

Obedience muſt be before perſeverance, but both obedience and perſeverance are by Faith. <hi>We walk by faith,</hi> and <hi>we ſtand by faith.</hi> All Apoſtacy from Chriſt is the fruit of unbelief? Heb. 3.12. <hi>Take heed Brethren, leſt there be in any of you an evil heart of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, in departing from the living God.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can keep the heart cloſe to duty in all conditions, but Faith firmly fixed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Authority of the Precepts, and the good of the promiſes. <hi>By faith Abraham when he was called to go out — obeyed, and he went out, not knowing whither he went.</hi> Heb. 11.8.

I am now from the authority of this Text to give you one call more; and I do, in the name of the great God, call and invite every ſinner of you this day to come to Chriſt, and take up his <hi>Yoke.</hi> And this is no other then the very call that Chriſt makes in the Goſpel. Mat. 11.28, 29, 30. <hi>Come to me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek, and lowly in heart: and ye ſhall find reſt to your ſouls, for my yoke is eaſy, and my burden is light.

                  <hi>Take my yoke upon you.]</hi> that implyes obeying. Faith and Obedience can't be ſeparated, every one that believes in Chriſt muſt obey the commands of Chriſt; If you come to him, you muſt take up his <hi>yoke.</hi> Pray conſider, it is the counſel of the Lord Chriſt, who knows what is for our good. He knows there is no life, no ſalvation, no happineſs, no Heaven without it: this is implyed in that reſt he promiſes; they ſhall find reſt in ſo doing, which ſuppoſes that without taking up his <hi>yoke,</hi> this <hi>reſt</hi> can never be had.</p>
               <p>Again, it is his counſel, who can, and will, reward all that practiſe it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore makes this promiſe, <hi>ye ſhall find reſt to your Souls.</hi> Mat. 11.29.

The latter is a peace which flows from Sanctification; and this is a fruit of <hi>Obedience</hi> to Chriſt; and therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to them that take up his <hi>yoke.</hi> And mark what kind of reſt it is that Chriſt promiſes, <hi>ye ſhall find reſt to your ſouls.</hi>] So that it is not an outward reſt, but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſpiritual reſt, the outward man may have leſs reſt and peace under Chriſts <hi>yoke</hi> then ever; your obedience to Chriſt may make the world hate you, reproach you, perſecute you: therefore Chriſt ſayes, <hi>In the world ye ſhall have trouble,</hi>

               <p n="1">1. Liberty. It holds but Chriſts <hi>yoke</hi> to be a <hi>yoke</hi> of Spiritual Liberty. His ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is perfect freedom, and therefore the Goſpel by which this <hi>yoke</hi> is put upon us, is called <hi>a law of liberty,</hi> Jam. 1.25. There is nothing more conſiſtent then obedience to Chriſt, and freedom of Spirit: <hi>Deo ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vire ſumma libertas,</hi> Pray which are moſt free, the good Angels in Heaven, or the
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:63179:229"/>

                  <hi>for I ſeek thy Precepts.</hi> Many decline the ways of God, and cleave faſt to their Luſts for the ſake of liberty. Whereas it is the greateſt ſlavery in the world to ſerve ſin: the little finger of luſt is heavyer then the whole loyns of Chriſt. Nothing makes a man ſuch a ſlave as ſin. He that lives in the love, and ſervice, and injoyment of God hath the trueſt freedom. But every ſinner is a vaſſal to luſt: at the command of every unclean motion. Is not he a ſlave that is at the will and command of Satan? That is moved and acted by Satan in his whole courſe? You pity men made ſlaves by the <hi>Turks;</hi> laid in chains; condemned to the Gallyes; grinding in Mills, broken with burdens; drub'd and beat after all. I tell you it is an eligible condition to this. Nay ſin doth not only make a man a ſlave but a bruit, for it bereaves him of all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and judgment, <hi>their is no judgment in their goings.</hi> Iſa. 59.8.</p>

And ſo it follows, Matt. 11.29, 30. <hi>Ye ſhall find reſt, for my yoke is eaſy, and my burden is light.</hi> A Believer in the ways of obedience hath thoſe aids of God, thoſe divine quickenings, thoſe daily ſupplyes of the Spirit, that Communion with God in all, that no duty is difficult or burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Heb. 4.9.</note> The ſervice of ſin is beſt at firſt, and worſt at laſt. Sin in the <hi>temptation</hi> is taking; but ſin in the <hi>concluſion</hi> is vexing.

His preſent condition is <hi>ſervile,</hi> but hereafter it will be <hi>dreadful.</hi> Firſt chains of <hi>Luſt,</hi>
                  <pb n="435" facs="tcp:63179:230"/>

               <p>Look upon this <hi>Yoke</hi> in ſuch duties as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer more immediately to God. Either in External Worſhip, or Internal.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In External Worſhip.</p>
               <p>As Prayer, how reaſonable is it that an indigent creature ſhould go to God for what he wants; ſeeing he can't ſupport himſelf let him go to him that can.</p>
               <p>Hearing how reaſonable it is that if God be to be obeyed, and this obedience is not to be by the creatures arbitrement, but
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:63179:231"/>
by Gods precept; that then I ſhould la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to know what Revelation he hath made of this.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Look on Internal Worſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Faith.</hi> How reaſonable is it that he who is the Eternal Truth ſhould have credence in all the diſcoveries of his will: and that I ſhould truſt him upon the credit of his promiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Love.</hi> It is the moſt reaſonable thing in the world I ſhould love God; becauſe he is the chief good; and becauſe he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways doing me good. Gods love to us comes under no reaſon but what is in himſelf, but our love to God is founded in the greateſt reaſon:<note place="margin">1 Joh. 4.19.</note> 
                  <hi>we love him becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>fear</hi> of God, how rational a duty is it; he being the higheſt Lord, and his ſupremacy abſolute. <hi>He is great, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore greatly to be feared.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Look upon the moſt difficult dutyes; <hi>Repentance, Self-denyal, Mortification of luſts,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe may be troubleſome to the fleſh, but not unreaſonable. What more equal than that I ſhould do whatever God would have me do, how contrary ſoever to fleſh and blood, and the dictates of a carnal mind?</p>
               <p n="2">2. He commands nothing that is preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to our intereſt. The end of every Precept is our felicity: both our ſpiritual and eternal good are promoted by it. And is there any thing more reaſonable then that a man ſhould perſue his own good?</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="437" facs="tcp:63179:231"/>3. He commands nothing but what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers the end of our being. The end though laſt in execution is firſt in intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now what is the great end of your being? young ones? what do you do in the world? let me ſay, as God ſaid to <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah, what make you here?</hi> What do you think God gave you being for? was it to pleaſe the fleſh? to ſuck the ſweet of the creatures? to paſs away your years in mirth and jollity? to live to your ſelves? Hath an immortal ſoul no other end of being but this? Surely yes, as God is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of being, ſo his glory ſhould be the end of being. You are come into this world to make proviſion for another; to avoid the ſnares of death, and lay hold on Eternal Life. To walk ſo before God here, as that you may ſecure his favour for ever. This is the great end of being; and how reaſonable is it that every man ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to that which he was born for. and came into the world for. Or elſe the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of man is in vain, as <hi>David</hi> expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the caſe, Pſal. 89.47. <hi>Wherefore haſt thou made all men in vain</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider the great advantage that comes by this, and that whatever your condition be.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe your extract be mean; that you are a branch of a poor Family. What an advantage will your ſubjection to Chriſt be in this caſe. For nothing can innoble and inrich you like this; Have you no friends?
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:63179:232"/>
this makes God your friend. Are you of a low extract: this ſhews you to be born of God. Is your education mean? why hereby you are taught of God. Have you none to leave you an inheritance? why God is your inheritance. Though you have neither houſe nor harbour, yet this ſecures you, <hi>an houſe not made with hands, Eternal in the Heavens.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.1. O what a comfortable thing it is to ſee the ſee of the poor to fear the Lord; it makes them rich in their poverty. <hi>I know thy poverty, but thou art rich,</hi> Rev. 2.9. It gives you a preference in the eſteem of God to the greateſt ſinners on earth. <hi>The Righteous is more excellent then his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 12.26.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Suppoſe you come out of the loyns of a rich Parentage. VVhat an advantage may this be, for you have nothing to mind but your ſoul, and your Salvation: others are forced to ſpend much of their youth in learning a calling whereby to get bread; but your Parents have laid up a plentiful eſtate for you, ſo that your work ſhould be to mind God. You have that time and leiſure that others have not, it may be ſaid of you as God ſaid to <hi>Iſrael, I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, houſes that ye builded not, and Vineyards that ye planted not.</hi> And what follows? <hi>Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fear the Lord, and ſerve him in ſincerity and truth.</hi> Joſh. 24.13, 14. This ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies all your enjoyments, and makes them
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:63179:232"/>
Bleſſings indeed, without this they are but fewel to your luſts, and ſo become a curſe and a ſnare. This then is one great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Chriſts <hi>yoke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is your ſubjection that proves your relation to Chriſt. Mal. 1.6. <hi>If I be a maſter where is my fear?</hi> The queſtion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes that whatever men pretend, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God is no farther own'd then as his will is obeyed. <hi>Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things I ſay?</hi> Luk. 6.46. and Matt. 12.50. <hi>He that doth the will of my father the ſame is my Brother, and Siſter, and Mother.</hi> Relations are not emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Titles, though they are <hi>minimae entita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> yet they are <hi>maximae efficaciae.</hi> They have a mutual <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and affection to each other. Obedience is the filling up of your relation to Chriſt. Now whom do ye obey? who hath your ſubjection? whoſe will do ye do? If ye call God father, and live in ſin, ye blaſpheme his holy name: you lay the devils brats at his door. If you ſay <hi>our Father,</hi> you muſt ſay, <hi>Thy will be done,</hi> and labour to do it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Your ſubjection to Chriſt is your proper qualification for glory. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. Submit to him here, and reign with him for ever. And your obedience to Chriſt dont give you a right to bleſſedneſs, that comes in by faith; but it diſpoſes and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifies for bleſſedneſs, a great advantage therefore.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="440" facs="tcp:63179:233"/>3. Conſider the diſadvantage of not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up Chriſts <hi>yoke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.) This ſpoils all your duties. If the heart be not ſubjected to Chriſt, no duty can pleaſe God. No obedience, no audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. If we will not hear God, he will not hear us, <hi>Quantum a praeceptis, tantum ab auribus dei longe ſamus. He that turns away his ear from hearing the law, his Prayer ſhall be abomination.</hi> prov. 28.9. If his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments can't prevail with us, nor ſhall ours with him. What is the great argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you are wont to uſe in pleading with God? it is the blood of Jeſus, Heb. 10.19. <hi>We have boldneſs by the blood of Jeſus.</hi> and Epheſ. 3.12. <hi>We have boldneſs and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs with confidence by the faith of him.</hi> Now this is the argument God uſes with you. Phil. 2.1. <hi>If there be therefore any Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Chriſt, — if any bowels and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</hi> If Gods beſeeching you by the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els and blood of Chriſt can't prevail with you to duty; why ſhould your pleading then with God prevail with him for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? for his blood was ſhed to redeem us to obedience, as well as to be the price of mercies.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) It renders all your hopes vain. The hope of a goodman ſhall never be fruſtrate, it ſhall be finiſhed, but never be diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. His hope ends in the fruition of the good hoped for. It is a living hope. But the hope of the ſinner is a dying, ſoul-un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing hope, that will certainly fail at laſt, and needs it muſt; For,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="441" facs="tcp:63179:233"/>1. It is a hope that hath no foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) None in the ſoul, what is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of hope there? I will give you it in two Scriptures. One is, 1 Pet. 1.3. <hi>Begotten us again to a lively hope.</hi> Their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation is made the ground of hope. The other is, Col. 1.27. <hi>Chriſt in you the hope of glory,</hi> There Union to Chriſt is made the ground of hope: So that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is a union to Chriſt by faith, and a change of ſtate by Regenerating grace, that man hath a foundation of hope in himſelf. No other man hath or can have.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His hope hath no foundation in the word, for that gives no countenance nor incouragement to hope in a ſtate of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; that tells you <hi>that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> 1 Cor. 6.9. it tells you that <hi>without holineſs no man ſhall ever ſee the Lord.</hi> Heb. 12.14. and therefore for a man to hope for Heaven in a ſtate of ſin, is to hope that the word of God is not true, or that God will not do as he ſaith; and how vain is that hope.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a hope that ſets Gods attributes at variance. It ſets mercy againſt juſtice; his goodneſs againſt his truth and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. God is as righteous as good; as juſt as he is merciful: and for an unſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied man to hope in the mercy of God, is to ſet his attributes at variance; for if he ſhew mercy to ſuch as live and dye in their
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:63179:234"/>
oppoſition to Chriſt, he can't be a juſt and righteous God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is a hope that gives the lye to Chriſt. For he hath with the moſt ſolemn aſſeveration averred that no man ſhall, or can ſee the Kingdom of God unleſs he be regenerate. Joh. 3.3. he hath ſaid <hi>the gate is ſtrait,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 7.14.</note> and <hi>the way narrow that leads to life, and but few find it.</hi> Now for a man to hope for Heaven without being born again, to hope to be ſaved in the broad way, is to hope that Chriſt will prove a falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is a hope that layes no ſtreſs upon any luſt, to ſubdue and weaken it. That hope that is right and genuine, purifies the heart. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3. But curſed is that hope that cheriſhes men in their Luſts; and curſed be thoſe luſts that fruſtrate a mans hope.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It renders all that Chriſt hath done about the purchaſing Salvation, as to you, vain and to no purpoſe. What a bleſſed work hath Chriſt undertaken! what great things hath he done! what great things hath he ſuffered! but if a man be not changed and made holy, it is all in vain as to him; becauſe Chriſt dyed for ſinners, this many look upon as a good ground for hope: but the queſtion if put home, muſt be this; did Chriſt ever dye to ſave impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent and unregenerate ſinners? did he dye to ſave ſuch as flight him; refuſe his <hi>yoke,</hi> and live and dye enemies to him? if
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:63179:234"/>
he did, then hope on; but if not, then there is no hope. Nay let me tell you it is out of the reach of Chriſts power to ſave any one of you in your luſts.<note place="margin">Mat. 1.21.</note> He can <hi>ſave you from your ſins,</hi> but he cannot ſave you in your ſins. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. He can't falſify his truſt. God the father hath put the great work of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and damnation into Chriſts hands. And how is ſalvation carryed on, but in purſuance of the election of God? look how God chooſes to Salvation, and ſo Chriſt carries it on. Now we are choſen <hi>that we ſhould be holy.</hi> Eph. 1.4. <hi>He hath choſen us through ſanctification of the Spirit unto obedience.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.2. And therefore Chriſt will ſave none that are not ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for he came to do the will of God, and he will not betray his truſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He cannot alter the ſtanding law of Heaven; and what is that? it is the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing law of Heaven, which the righteous God hath fixed more firm than the Sun in the Firmament, and will never vary from it, that a man muſt <hi>repent,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 13.2.</note> and turn to Chriſt, <hi>or periſh.</hi> He muſt <hi>be converted,</hi> or he ſhall <hi>in no wiſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Matt. 18.3. He muſt take the <hi>yoke</hi> of Chriſt upon him,<note place="margin">Heb. 3.18.</note> or he ſhall never find reſt to his Soul.<note place="margin">Mat. 5.8.</note> None but <hi>the pure in heart ſhall ſee God.</hi> This is the ſtanding law of Heaven; and how then can the unbelieving and diſobedient be ſaved? ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the law of Heaven muſt be reverſed,
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:63179:235"/>
or ſinners are eternally undone, and will Chriſt, who revealed this law to the world, reverſe it again to gratifie thy luſts?</p>
               <p n="3">3. He can't make void his own offices. Why hath God made him a King? but to ſubdue ſinners to himſelf, to conquer the nolency of the will, to ſet up his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and rule in the heart; and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due and deſtroy the rebels; <hi>He reigns</hi> that he may <hi>put all his enemies under his feet.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.25.</note> And if ſo, what ſhall become of diſobedient ſinners? can you think that this <hi>Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dek,</hi> this <hi>King of Righteouſneſs</hi> will ever countenance the impenitent and unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? will he take thoſe to reign with him in his <hi>Kingdom of glory,</hi> that would not that he ſhould rule over them in the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of grace?</hi> This were to violate the rights of his Crown, which you cannot think he will do, if you do but conſider two Scriptures, one is, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.27. <hi>Thoſe mine enemies that would not that I ſhould reign over them, bring hither, and ſlay them before me.</hi> The other is in 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.7, 8, 9. <hi>The Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</hi> And how do you that ſlight Chriſt think to eſcape this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence? will not the judgment of the great
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:63179:235"/>
day of the Lord be very terrible to all that live and dye in their luſts? can you bear it? <hi>Can thy heart indure, or thy hand be made ſtrong in the day that I ſhall deal with thee?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 22.14.</note> If not, then be wiſe, and <hi>flee from wrath to come;</hi> and there is but one way, and that is by cloſing with Jeſus Chriſt, and giving your ſelves up to an intire ſubjection to his <hi>yoke.</hi> There is no way to eſcape wrath, and ſecure eternal life but this. You read of a <hi>ſtrait gate,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 7.14.</note> and a <hi>narrow way that leads to life.</hi> The <hi>yoke</hi> of the ſpirit in convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to converſion, that is the <hi>ſtrait gate;</hi> and the <hi>yoke</hi> of Chriſt in holineſs and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, that is the <hi>narrow way,</hi> and there is no other: and as our Lord Chriſt ſayes, <hi>few there be that find it.</hi> Is there any ſinner here now that ſtands convinced of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of undertaking this duty, that you muſt take up Chriſts <hi>yoke,</hi> or you muſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in your ſins? I hope you are, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall lay you down ſome directions to help and guide you in this work.</p>
               <p>Take heed of miſtaking the <hi>yoke</hi> of Chriſt.<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Direct. </seg>1</label> Some will tell you it lies in this way of worſhip, ſome in that, as Chriſt ſayes, many will ſay, <hi>lo here is Chriſt,</hi>

                  <hi>and lo their is Chriſt, believe them not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some will perſwade you it lyes in cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious ſervices, and humane traditions, but this is the <hi>yoke</hi> of men, and not the <hi>yoke</hi> of Chriſt, and therefore take heed of it. If you would know which is the <hi>yoke</hi> of Chriſt, you muſt be guided by the word
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:63179:236"/>
of Chriſt, for nothing is duty but what the word commands.</p>
               <p>Some will tell you it lyes in Popery, but this is the <hi>yoke</hi> of Antichriſt; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you that are <hi>young ones</hi> take heed of this <hi>yoke;</hi> for it is none of Chriſts. It is a grievous <hi>yoke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It binds you from the uſe of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which are able to make you wiſe to Salvation. It ties you up to worſhip God in an unknown tongue, in a language you don't underſtand. It ties you to make uſe of many Mediators, whereas <hi>there is but one Mediator between God and man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.5.</note> 
                  <hi>the man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> It ties you to believe againſt your ſenſes. To believe that a blind ſottiſh Prieſt can with a few words convert a wafer into the very body and blood of Chriſt; and then you muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it to be the very ſubſtance of Chriſt; againſt Scripture, againſt Reaſon, and againſt Senſe. For though the Scripture calls it ſtill bread, and though you break bread, and ſee bread, and taſt and eat bread, yet you muſt believe it not to be bread. It ties you to believe many abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable errors and falſe Doctrines, as that of merit by works, though Chriſt ſayes, <hi>when we have done all, we muſt ſay we are unprofitable ſervants.</hi> Luk. 17.10. And that of the infallibility of the Pope, and his Supremacy over all Churches and Princes; and that if he doth but excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate any Prince, and pronounce him
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:63179:236"/>
a Heretick, it is lawful to murder him. It is full of ſuch abominable Doctrines. Oh therefore never come under this <hi>yoke;</hi> it is an idolatrous <hi>yoke,</hi> a cruel bloody <hi>yoke,</hi> a heavy intolerable <hi>yoke;</hi> a <hi>yoke</hi> which neither we nor our fore-fathers were able to bear, therefore they wiſely caſt it off: and let us rather chooſe to dye then put it on again, for it is none of the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>If you would reſolve to take up Chriſts <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Direct. </seg>2</label> 
                  <hi>yoke,</hi> then you muſt remove all hinderan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to this duty, whatever may be a ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling block, or obſtruct you in your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. I have named many in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of this diſcourſe, let me name 6 more now.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One is, a thinking this <hi>yoke</hi> of Chriſt too ſtrict and burdenſome; this hinders many. But never any that took it up found it ſo: and they that never tryed can't judge of it. This is a meer ſubtilty of Satan to miſ-repreſent the ways of Chriſt, that we may periſh in our prejudices. He deters young ones with this conceit, that Chriſt is a hard Maſter, farewel all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and comfort if once you take up this <hi>yoke,</hi> whereas the deſign of Chriſt is the pleaſure and comfort of the ſoul. <hi>His ways are ways of Pleaſantneſs, and all his paths peace.</hi> Prov. 3.17. Are not the fruits of the Spirit more ſweet and comfortable then the works of the Fleſh? It is Satan that is the hard Maſter, that commands
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:63179:237"/>
ſuch unreaſonable things: and then after all inſtead of a reward of your ſervice, deprives you of your peace, your comfort, your innocence, the favour of God, the benefit of Chriſts blood, and the hope of Heaven. O did we but ſeriouſly believe a life to come, a glory to be revealed, we would think nothing much that might ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us capable of that bleſſedneſs. What will not men do and ſuffer for a Crown, though but fading and tranſitory? It is ſtoryed of <hi>Alexander,</hi> that he provided a Crown, and promiſed it to him that ſhould at ſuch a Feaſt drink moſt; and four (the Story ſayes) drunk themſelves dead to get the Crown. Shall men hazard Soul and Body for a poor fading Crown, and ſhall we think any thing hard for a Crown that fades not?<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.25.</note> 
                  <hi>They for a corruptible crown, we for an incorruptible.</hi> Don't think this <hi>yoke</hi> of Chriſt too ſtrict therefore.</p>
               <p n="2">.2 Another hinderance is a worldly Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. I tell you, of all perſons the covetous are hardly perſwaded to come to Chriſt. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch do love to take up a Profeſſion to cover and colour their ſin, but not to take up Chriſts <hi>yoke,</hi> for then they muſt lay aſide their ſin. And if you look into Scripture you ſhall find that this one ſin kept more from Chriſt then any other. What made the <hi>Gadarens</hi> weary of Chriſt among them, but the worldly intereſt?<note place="margin">Mat. 8.34.</note> What made the <hi>Phariſees</hi> deride him and his Doctrine,<note place="margin">Luk. 16.14.</note> but their covetouſneſs?

thoſe gueſts that were bidden to the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding feaſt, to make light of it,<note place="margin">Luk. 14.17, 18, 19, 20.</note> but the <hi>farm,</hi> and the <hi>Merchandiſe,</hi> and the <hi>new marryed wife?</hi> And what made that hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful young man to forſake Chriſt, and part, after ſuch fair hopes given? it was this one thing. <hi>One thing thou lackeſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mark 10.21.22.</note> 
                  <hi>ſell that thou haſt and give to the poor, and come and follow me.</hi> O you that are young; I pray think of this young man, and don't do as he did.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſcandalous miſcarriages of profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and their unſuitable walking; this hinders many, and hardens them againſt the ways of Chriſt. But this is unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to judge of the <hi>Laws</hi> of Chriſt by the <hi>lives</hi> of men. To condemn the rule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome ſwerve from it; The queſtion is, doth the law of Chriſt countenance this? doth it give the leaſt indulgence to any one ſin? no, it is <hi>holy, juſt and good.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7.12.</note> The way of Chriſt is holy, though all that profeſs it are not ſo. Gold is excellent, though all is not Gold that gliſters. You will not refuſe to take Gold becauſe it is ſometimes counterfeited. Becauſe ſome Profeſſors are proud and vain, others co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous and baſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore you will never go for Profeſſors. Becauſe you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve one Church-Member drunk, another deceitful in his dealing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore you will never joyn to the Church. O take heed of this, for you are to look to the rule, and to walk by that, Gal. 6.16.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="450" facs="tcp:63179:238"/>4. Another hinderance is a preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of finding mercy at any time. Indeed this hath undone many. And therefore let me tell you, mercy is in bringing you under Chriſts <hi>yoke;</hi> it is not to keep you from taking it up. If hope of mercy here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after make you neglect the taking up Chriſts <hi>yoke</hi> for the preſent, you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by the hope of mercy.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Another hinderance is wicked com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. Oh how many have been undone by bad company! many that have in youth had great convictions, made fair and hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful beginnings, uſed to pray in ſecret, and read the Scriptures, and make conſcience of the Lords day, by falling into wicked company have loſt all. Their convictions are ſtifled, duties laid aſide, God forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, his day profaned, and ſo their hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful beginning like to come to a ſad end. Whoever got good by bad company? Oh remember <hi>Peter,</hi> he would venture into the high Prieſts Hall, and company with them, and what came of it? it ended in a denyal of Chriſt. <hi>Evil communication corrupts good manners.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.33. And yet many young ones dare frolick it in all companies, drink, dance, revel, run to play houſes, and worſe houſes too, and yet dread no danger.</p>
               <p>O young ones! of all things take heed of bad company. Never ſuch a generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of young ſinners as in this day; that dare not only be drunk, and unclean, and
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:63179:238"/>
ſwear; but dare ſcoff at Religion, make a mock at Godlineſs, laugh at Heaven and Hell, and in contempt of God dare him to damn them at every word. And dare you be found a companion to ſuch as theſe? O let me ſay to you as <hi>Moſes</hi> did concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Corah,</hi> and his wicked company, <hi>depart I pray you from the Tents of theſe wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, leſt ye be conſumed in their ſins.</hi> Numb. 16.26. For <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes, <hi>the companion of fools ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi> Prov. 13.20. Let me tell you, I never look to ſee you own Chriſt, nor the ways of Chriſt, till you reſolvedly ſhake off your wicked companions, and ſay as <hi>David</hi> did, Pſal. 119.115. <hi>Depart from me ye evil doers, for I will keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of my God.</hi> What ſayes <hi>Solomon</hi> to his ſon, Prov. 1.10. <hi>My ſon, if ſinners in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice thee, conſent thou not.</hi> One will entice thee from a Sermon, to go to an Alehouſe; another to a Brothel houſe; &amp;c. conſent not, touch no unclean thing, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. a man that had a running iſſue under the Law was unclean, and he that touched him was unclean. <hi>Lev.</hi> 15.7. <hi>Can a man touch pitch and not be defiled?</hi> wicked men are as infectious as the plague; and therefore ſhun them as you would do one that hath a running ſoar. Reſolve to forſake all that have forſaken God. Prov. 9.6. <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the fooliſh, and live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Another hinderance, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſt of all, is the <hi>yoke</hi> of ſin and luſt. While
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:63179:239"/>
your neck is under this <hi>yoke,</hi> you can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver put on Chriſts; Chriſt and Luſt are two ſuch Maſters that no man can ever ſerve both. If any one ſin be indulged and ſpared, you can never be true to Chriſt. You muſt be divorced from all ſin, or you cannot be Marryed to Chriſt, therefore remove all hinderances to the duty.</p>

               <p n="1">1. It is a buſineſs of life and death; and what a fooliſh thing it is for a man to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate whether he ſhall be ſaved or damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, go to Heaven or Hell.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By continuance in the ways of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience the heart is made more obſtinate, as a path becomes the harder by frequent treading. Sin is of a hardening nature, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13. So that if converſion to Chriſt be hard to day, it will be harder to morrow, and ſo every day adds to its difficulty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the heart grows harder and harder.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You ſuffer great loſs by delays. What grace might you have gotten e're this had you begun betimes! what victories over ſin, what experiences, what communion with God, what evidences for heaven.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There are ſpecial ſeaſons of grace which are but for a limited time, and in complying with, or ſlighting theſe, the happineſs or miſery of man is fixed. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe to every purpoſe there is time and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, therefore the miſery of man is great up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 8.6.</note> If your ſeaſons of grace are loſt, they are never to be redeem'd. Now I pray conſider, in what part of life is it moſt probable that (in the wiſdom of God) theſe are placed? in youth, or in old age? Can you think that God would choſe the infirmities and dotages of life for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, rather then the ſtrength and vigour of your days and affections.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="455" facs="tcp:63179:240"/>5. The ſlighting of your ſpecial ſeaſons is the way to loſe them. Luk. 19.42. Gen. 6.3. <hi>Theſe three years I come looking for fruit and find none.</hi> And what follows? <hi>cut it down, why cumbers it the ground.</hi> Luk. 13.7. Three years they had injoy'd Chriſts mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and yet brought forth no fruit, and therefore Chriſt caſts them off. O ſirs! how many years hath Chriſt been calling of you, and waiting for fruit, <hi>why ſtand ye all the day idle?</hi> Remember the fooliſh Virgins, and tremble, and get Oyl while the Market is open.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Thou doſt not know how near thy day of account may be. It is many times neareſt, when we think it is fartheſt off. We are many times moſt <hi>ſecure,</hi> when we are leaſt <hi>ſafe.</hi>

And what follows? <hi>The Lord of that ſervant ſhall come in a day that he looks not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of.</hi> Little did the old world think of a flood ſo nigh when they gave themſelves to ſenſuality. Or <hi>Sodom</hi> of fire from Heaven when they burn'd in their luſts. <hi>So ſhall it be when the ſon of man comes.</hi> Luk. 17.30.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Conſider this; If any of you that have heard theſe Sermons of taking up Chriſts <hi>yoke</hi> betimes, ſhall dare yet to live in the neglect of this duty; This word that I have ſpoken to you in the name of the Lord, and this call that God hath

made to you by me, will be a dreadful wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt ſuch refuſers in the laſt day, and that which I have intended for your converſion will turn to your deſtruction and damnation.</p>
               <p>But God forbid: what ſhall I run in vain, and labour in vain? nay ſhall the Lord Chriſt call in vain, and his Bleſſed Spirit ſtrive with you in vain. Therefore I beſeech you lay things to heart, and let me know what you intend; Will you at laſt be prevail'd with to ſubmit to Chriſt, and take up his <hi>yoke</hi> forthwith, without any more delay? if not, let me tell you God will look upon you from this day as wilful refuſers of his grace and love; and it <hi>ſhall be more tolerable for Sodom and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah, then for you.</hi> But if you have a heart now to accept of Chriſt, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to him, and to take up his <hi>yoke</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more delay, you have done your work, you have ſaved your ſouls. Now God is yours, Chriſt is yours, Peace, Life, Salvation, all the good of the Covenant, all the glory of Heaven is yours, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you are bleſſed and happy for ever. For as your preſent choice is, ſuch ſhall your Eternal Condition be. The Lord perſwade ſinners to know the things of their peace, before they are hid from their eyes.</p>
